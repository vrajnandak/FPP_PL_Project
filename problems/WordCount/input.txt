The Simpsons includes a large array of supporting characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople, local celebrities, fictional characters within the show and even animals. The writers originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and have subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to the creator of The Simpsons, Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the Canadian sketch comedy show Second City Television.

Club ] [ Agnes Skinner ] Agnes Skinner, voiced by Tress MacNeille is the mother of school principal Seymour Skinner and first appeared in the first season episode &quot; The Crepes of Wrath &quot; as an old woman who embarrassingly calls her son &quot; Spanky &quot;. However, as episodes progressed, the character turned bitter. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { The Crepes of Wrath &quot; } She is very harshly controlling of Seymour, and treats him like a mother would a small child, once grounding him because he did not say who was at the door after answering it, when it was &quot; The Sugarman &quot;. She hates Edna Krabappel. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Special Edna &quot; } Agnes has married a total of four times, once with Skinner&apos;s father, Sheldon Skinner, and following Sheldon&apos;s death she then married three more times, each time, to a tow truck driver. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Midnight Towboy &quot; } Several Springfield residents (including the Simpsons) are afraid of her. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { The Principal and the Pauper &quot; } When Agnes&apos; real son, &quot; the real Seymour Skinner &quot; arrives in Springfield, Agnes turns him away, unhappy with her new living situation, largely because the true Seymour Skinner is a man who can stand up to Agnes and make his own decisions. Although she appears to not care for the fake Skinner, it turns out she really loves him, although she denies it in &quot; Large Marge &quot;. Agnes&apos;s first name was revealed in the seventh season episode &quot; Bart the Fink &quot;. { Richmond, p. 196 } Before that, the character was known as &quot; Mrs. Skinner &quot;. In the beginning of the series, the writers made several references to Agnes and Seymour&apos;s relationship being similar to that of Norman Bates and his mother&apos;s in the film Psycho. { Jean, Al (2003). Easter egg commentary for &quot; } { Separate Vocations &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } In &quot; Boy Meets Curl, &quot; it is revealed that some of Agnes&apos; resentment to Seymour may have derived from even before Seymour was born  — during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Agnes competed in the pole vaulting event while 9-months pregnant. When Seymour makes his first kick, he hits the bar, thus, making Agnes lose and subsequently crushing her dreams. { &quot; } { Boy Meets Curl, &quot; first aired February 14, 2010 } However, this would contradict the earlier episode when it is revealed that Seymour isn&apos;t her birth son. [ Akira ] Akira, works as a waiter at The Happy Sumo, a Japanese restaurant in Springfield. He first appeared in the second season in &quot; One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish &quot;. Actor George Takei originally voiced Akira in &quot; One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish &quot;. Since Akira&apos;s speaking role in &quot; When Flanders Failed &quot;, Hank Azaria has voiced the character, doing an impression of Takei for the voice. { Jean, Al (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { When Flanders Failed &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Anastasia ] Anastasia is a tiger that performs in casinos with Gunter and Ernst. She debuts in &quot; $pringfield &quot;, where it is explained she was captured from the wild by Ernst and Gunter. She reappears in &quot; Viva Ned Flanders &quot;, performing in Las Vegas. In &quot; The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons &quot;, Gunter and Ernst lose it. [ Arnie Pye ] Arnie Pye, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, is a disgruntled, somewhat eccentric helicopter traffic reporter for Springfield&apos;s KBBL-TV (Channel 6). His name and appearance are a parody of the famous, Pulitzer winning 1930s journalist, Ernie Pyle. His segments are titled &quot; Arnie (or &quot; Pye &quot; ) in the Sky &quot;. He has an apparent dislike of anchorman Kent Brockman, with whom he often gets into arguments on the air, and Brockman once snarled that Arnie was a &quot; jackass &quot;. In earlier episodes he had the name &apos;Bill Pye&apos;. [ Arthur Crandall and Gabbo ] Arthur Crandall and Gabbo (both voiced by Hank Azaria ) are a puppet and ventriloquist who start their own TV show that is in competition with Krusty the Clown &apos;s. The show is a huge hit that ruins Krusty&apos;s career, but Bart then ruins Gabbo&apos;s future by capturing him making a rude comment on TV. The pair are later reduced to low-paying work such as a show at an Indian casino. The pair mainly appeared in season four&apos;s &quot; Krusty Gets Kancelled &quot; but they also appeared in &quot; Bart to the Future &quot;, &quot; Homerazzi &quot;, &quot; All About Lisa &quot;, and The Simpsons Movie. [ Artie Ziff ] Artie Ziff is a former classmate of Marge who becomes an Internet millionaire. He is voiced by Jon Lovitz in all appearances, except for season four&apos;s &quot; The Front &quot;, where he was voiced by Dan Castellaneta. [ Jean, Al The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season DVD Video ] In &quot; The Ziff Who Came to Dinner &quot;, where after he loses his bankrupt company to Homer, Homer is taken away by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for bankrupting the company, although Artie confesses in the end and goes to jail instead. Strongly disliked by Marge since their experience at the senior prom when he attempts to grope her, he eventually comes to terms with the fact that his personality, not his religion ( Judaism ), is the reason he is disliked. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Half-Decent Proposal &quot; } Animator David Silverman based Ziff&apos;s appearance and body language of a man he went to high school with.

He makes his first appearance in &quot; Sweet Seymour Skinner&apos;s Baadasssss Song &quot;, where Lisa refers to Baby Gerald as Maggie&apos;s rival. On a few occasions, Gerald has been shown being pushed in a stroller by his mother outside the Simpson house as in &quot; Lady Bouvier&apos;s Lover &quot;, as the two babies glare at one another. The character&apos;s name was revealed in the episode &quot; The Canine Mutiny &quot;. { Richmond, p. 223 } [ Benjamin, Doug and Gary ] Benjamin, Doug, and Gary (voiced by Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria, and Dan Castellaneta, respectively) are geek s that were once Homer&apos;s dormitory roommates at Springfield University. Gary carries a calculator on his belt and uses ear medicine, Doug is overweight and wears a pocket protector, and Benjamin is black and wears horn-rimmed glasses. { Richmond, p122. } The writer of &quot; Homer Goes to College &quot; Conan O&apos;Brien partially based them on three guys he went to college with, who, he said, were &quot; incredible nerds &quot;. { O&apos;Brien, Conan (2004).

She is Dr. Julius Hibbert &apos;s wife and is loosely based on the Clair Huxtable character from The Cosby Show. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Duffless &quot; } She has two boys and a girl with Julius. Nevertheless, her marriage is on the rocks; { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Dude, Where&apos;s My Ranch? &quot; } Bernice refuses to kiss Julius, even when an entire audience is looking at them. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play &quot; } Her drinking has been joked about on several occasions; she faints when she reads that prohibition had been introduced to Springfield { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment &quot; } and attends Springfield Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Days of Wine and D&apos;oh&apos;ses &quot; } [ Bill and Marty ] Bill and Marty, voiced by Harry Shearer and Dan Castellaneta, are two radio show hosts and DJs on Springfield&apos;s own radio station KBBL. Marty is middle-aged and balding, while Bill is younger and has a full head of hair. They are responsible for giving Bart his elephant, Stampy, although they were surprised when Bart wanted Stampy, because they thought he would choose the other prize, $10,000. When Mr. Burns monopolized the local media in Fraudcast News, he fired the duo, but they have returned to the job in later episodes. [ Billy ] Billy is Troy McClure &apos;s assistant who appeared in &quot; Lisa the Simpson &quot;, and &quot; Bart the Mother &quot;. He was supposed to appear in more episodes but due to McClure&apos;s voice actor Phil Hartman &apos;s death, he was retired along with McClure. He is a child who appears in Troy McClure&apos;s educational films. He appears in the films &quot; Birds: Our Fine Feathered Colleagues &quot;, and &quot; In The Kitchen with DNA &quot;. He was voiced by Tress MacNeille. A similar child named Jimmy (who at one point McClure also calls Billy) appears in &quot; The Meat Council Presents: &apos;Meat and You: Partners in Freedom&apos; &quot; in the episode, &quot; Lisa the Vegetarian &quot;. [ Birch Barlow ] Birchibald &quot; Birch &quot; T. Barlow (voiced by Harry Shearer on &quot; Sideshow Bob Roberts &quot; and Maurice LaMarche on &quot; You Kent Always Say What You Want &quot; ). He is a conservative talk show host on the radio station KBBL, who in voice and appearance is modeled after Rush Limbaugh. As of &quot; You Kent Always Say What You Want &quot;, he also has a show on Fox News, and serves as a parody of Fox News conservative bias. On his radio show, he declares himself to be &quot; the fourth branch of government &quot; and &quot; the fifty-first state &quot;. He is also the author of the book Only Turkey s Have Left Wings. Barlow plays an important part in the episode &quot; Sideshow Bob Roberts &quot;, in which Sideshow Bob, while jailed, calls Barlow on his radio show, giving Bob an outlet to voice how the prison treats him unfairly. Barlow, knowing Bob is a fellow Republican, sympathizes with his complaints, and influences the rest of Springfield to as well. This leads to Bob&apos;s prompt release and ensuing mayor al election-rigging. Barlow also appears in the episode &quot; We&apos;re on the Road to D&apos;ohwhere &quot; as a customer at Marge&apos;s prescription drug-laden &quot; yard sale &quot;, a reference to Limbaugh&apos;s Oxycontin addiction. Most recently Barlow appears with other Springfield Republicans in the episode &quot; E Pluribus Wiggum &quot;, in which he tells Lisa to make Ralph Wiggum decide whether he wants to run for President as a Republican or a Democrat. [ &quot; Bleeding Gums &quot; Murphy ] &quot; Bleeding Gums &quot; Murphy, voiced by Ron Taylor and Daryl L. Coley, { Daryl L. Coley TV.com. URL accessed on December 7, 2006 } was a jazz musician, idol, and mentor of Lisa Simpson. His actual first name has never been revealed, though Murphy claimed his nickname came from the fact he had never once been to a dentist, as &quot; I got enough pain in my life as it is &quot;. His significant roles were in the episodes &quot; Moaning Lisa &quot; and &quot; &apos;Round Springfield &quot;, though he appears in other episodes, such as &quot; Bart the Daredevil &quot; (where he is yellow), &quot; Dancin&apos; Homer &quot;, &quot; Old Money &quot;, &quot; Flaming Moe&apos;s, &quot; Bart Gets an F &quot;, &quot; Radio Bart &quot;, and &quot; Lisa&apos;s Pony &quot;. In &quot; Dancin&apos; Homer &quot;, he was voiced by Daryl L. Coley. In &quot; Round Springfield we learn that at one point he had enjoyed a fairly successful career, releasing an album ( &quot; Sax on the Beach &quot; ) and appearing on Steve Allen &apos;s Tonight Show, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { &apos;Round Springfield &quot; } and as one of the Cosby children&apos;s four grandfathers on an episode of The Cosby Show, but quickly lost his money feeding his $1500-a-day habit of purchasing and smashing Fabergé egg s. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Moaning Lisa &quot; } He had taught Lisa to display her emotions through music, prompting Lisa to hold him as an important figure in her life. His last appearance was in &quot; &apos;Round Springfield &quot; { &apos;Round Springfield The Simpsons.com. URL accessed on December 14, 2006 } - after Bart ends up in the hospital, Lisa wanders off to find Murphy dying in a nearby ward. He explains about his life, family, and work to her as well as giving her advice for her upcoming school performance, giving her his saxophone. When Lisa returns, she finds out that Bleeding Gums has died from circumstances which are never revealed. No one, except for Lisa, attends Murphy&apos;s funeral. Lisa soon learns that though he may be gone, he still is alive in her. It is strongly hinted that Murphy and Doctor Hibbert are long-lost brothers, most notably by Murphy&apos;s quote: &quot; I don&apos;t really have a family. All I had was a little brother who grew up to become a doctor. He used to laugh at the most inappropriate times. &quot; Hibbert then laughs inappropriately and says, &quot; Hey, I&apos;ve got an older brother that I&apos;ll never see. He&apos;s a jazz musician or some such. Oh well, bye, bye. &quot; Bleeding Gums Murphy is loosely based on Blind Willie Johnson, at whose feet the young Bleeding Gums character learned. { Matt Groening, DVD commentary for the episode &quot; &apos;Round Springfield &quot; } The voice of Bleeding Gums Murphy was provided by Ron Taylor, while his saxophone playing is provided by Dan Higgins. { Dan Higgins Biography Dan Higgins.net. URL accessed on December 15, 2006 } As a sign of respect for the character, Murphy has been a fixture of The Simpsons opening sequence since the second season. Originally, even after his death, Bart would skateboard past him on the street.In &quot; The Great Wife Hope &quot; Bleeding Gums Murphy is mentioned and supposedly according to Carl he is still alive after Homer asks Carl if he knows African-American boxer Drederick Tatum; Carl takes offense, saying that just because he is African American, he doesn&apos;t know all the other African-American citizens in Springfield. Carl then says that he met Drederick Tatum while he was at a party with Dr. Hibbert at Bleeding Gums Murphy&apos;s house. { Opening Sequence SNPP. } [ Blinky ] Blinky is a three-eyed orange fish featured primarily in &quot; Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish &quot;. Likely mutated by toxic waste from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant pouring into the river, Blinky became a major news story when he was caught by Bart Simpson. Mr. Burns defends the fish, arguing that his extra eye is merely the next step in evolution. Mr. Burns later goes to the Simpsons&apos; house for a meal to boost his race for governor. Marge, a supporter of Burns&apos; opponent Mary Bailey, deliberately serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns spits the fish out and subsequently loses the election. Blinky was briefly seen again in episodes &quot; Homer&apos;s Odyssey &quot; and &quot; Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in &quot; The Curse of the Flying Hellfish &quot; &quot;. Blinky also made a brief appearance in an underwater section of tube-way Fry travels through in the pilot episode of the animated series Futurama, which was created by Simpsons creator Matt Groening. [ Blue Haired Lawyer ] Mr. Burns&apos; Lawyer, { Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { Bart Gets Hit by a Car &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } also known as &quot; The Blue-Haired Lawyer &quot;, is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. { Gimple, p. 86 } He first appeared in the second season episode &quot; Bart Gets Hit by a Car &quot;. { Richmond, p. 153 } He is Springfield&apos;s most prominent and powerful lawyer, known for his blue hair and nasal New York accent. He also occasionally appears to serve as a prosecutor. Unlike Lionel Hutz or Gil Gunderson, he is a competent though not necessarily ethical lawyer. He has served as Mr. Burns &apos; head lawyer, helping him out with threats of the Power Plant closing down and of Burns losing his money. He is a member of the Springfield Republican Party. His clients often tend to be antagonists of the Simpsons. The Blue Haired Lawyer played a very important role in Bart&apos;s emancipation in &quot; Barting Over &quot; and works at a law firm named &quot; Luvum and Burnam &quot;. The character&apos;s demeanor, as well as Dan Castellaneta&apos;s voice for the character, are based on Roy Cohn, best known as Joe McCarthy &apos;s chief counsel during the Communist witchhunts in the 1950s. Animator Jim Reardon modeled the character&apos;s appearance on actor Charles Lane. { Reardon, Jim (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { Bart the Fink &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Boobarella ] Boobarella is an ample-chested vampire -looking woman, first seen in the episode &quot; I&apos;m Spelling as Fast as I Can &quot;. She is aware of the size of her breasts, and often makes reference to them on the rare occasion she appears on TV. Her character is a takeoff of Elvira, a character portrayed by Cassandra Peterson, herself a takeoff of Vampira. Her name is probably a takeoff from Vampirella and the 1968 cult science fiction/fantasy/horror film Barbarella, which stars Jane Fonda in the title role. Boobarella uses a stereotypical Eastern European &quot; horror &quot; accent and makes school supplies. [ Brandine Spuckler ] Brandine Spuckler is voiced by Tress MacNeille and is the partner of Cletus Spuckler. Brandine and Cletus are depicted as stereotypical yokels. Throughout the series, the two are shown to be brother and sister, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Alone Again, Natura-Diddily &quot; } boyfriend and girlfriend, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { There&apos;s Something About Marrying &quot; } mother and son, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { The Italian Bob &quot; } and father and daughter. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Little Big Girl &quot; } She is apparently the daughter of Cletus and an alien. She has suffered from rabies, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Goo Goo Gai Pan &quot; } and admitted to being illiterate. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot; } More recently, Brandine is shown fighting in the Iraq War. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Yokel Chords &quot; } She comes back revealing Cletus is the father of only two of the kids, casting doubt over the paternity of her other children. Assuming that all of the children believed to be Cletus&apos; are also hers, Brandine has 45 specifically named children. Brandine and Cletus were married by Homer during his brief stint as a priest. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Simple Simpson &quot; } On April 27, 2008, more is revealed about Cletus and Brandine in an episode entitled &quot; Apocalypse Cow &quot;; Brandine had married Cletus at the age of 13, and had married four times before that. Some of the most distinct features of Brandine are that she speaks in a thick accent, and wears her red hair up in a high ponytail. [ Brunella Pommelhorst ] The school gym teacher, voiced by Tress MacNeille / Maggie Roswell (in Moaning Lisa) First appeared in &quot; Moaning Lisa &quot;, although her name is not mentioned until &quot; The PTA Disbands &quot;. She has blond hair and usually wears a whistle and takes a tough-as-nails approach to teaching. In &quot; Little Girl in the Big Ten &quot;, she decides that because of the oath she took on Xena, she has to fail Lisa but decides to let her make it up by taking private lessons. In a more recent episode, &quot; My Fair Laddy &quot;, she decides to leave for the year and return the next semester as &quot; Mr. Pommelhorst, the new shop teacher. &quot; [ Bumblebee Man ] The Bumblebee Man, voiced by Hank Azaria, is the star of a Spanish-language television sitcom on &quot; Channel Ocho &quot;, in which he dresses in a bumblebee costume and performs slapstick comedy. In the episode &quot; Team Homer &quot;, his bowling shirt bears the name &quot; Pedro &quot;. He works at the same studio as Kent Brockman. His first appearance was in &quot; Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie &quot;. Bumblebee Man is never seen to take off his costume, even when by himself; the sole exception is the episode &quot; 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot;, in which his private life is shown. In this short segment, he is portrayed as innately clumsy rather than simply acting as such. In general, Bumblebee Man only speaks in simple, over-enunciated (and inaccurate) Spanish sentences. His catchphrases of choice are typically &quot; ¡Ay, ay, ay, no me gusta! &quot; ( &quot; I don&apos;t like it! &quot; ), &quot; ¡Ay, ay, ay, no es bueno! &quot; ( &quot; That&apos;s not good! &quot; ) and &quot; ¡Ay, Dios no me ama! &quot; ( &quot; God doesn&apos;t love me! &quot; ). Quite commonly, his phrases will be intentionally sloppy Spanish. For example, in the episode &quot; 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot;, there are several words used that are not real (such as &quot; wudpequero &quot; for &quot; woodpecker &quot;, rather than the correct pájaro carpintero). The crude Spanish is used so that English-speaking viewers would still understand what was being said. { Season 7 DVD Commentary - &quot; } { 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot; } On occasions, he also speaks English, such as briefly in &quot; Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington &quot;. In &quot; Bart Gets Famous &quot;, he anchored the news with an articulate English accent, filling in for the regular, Kent Brockman. Bumblebee Man is a caricature of El Chapulín Colorado, a character created and portrayed by Mexican television comedian Roberto Gómez Bolaños (a.k.a. &quot; Chespirito &quot; ), and his show consists of simple skits, often involving heavy slapstick. The staff have said that whenever they watched Telemundo, this character was &quot; always on &quot;, thus they created Bumblebee Man, who is also always on the air when the Spanish-language channel is depicted. [ Reiss, Mike 2004 The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] His costume was based on one used in the Saturday Night Live sketch &quot; Killer Bees &quot;. [ Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves 2007-08-15 2000-10-21 TV Guide Joe Rhodes ] Hank Azaria won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Bumblebee Man, and various other characters, in 2003. [ http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search Emmys.org 2008-11-05 ] [ Capital City Goofball ] The Capital City Goofball is the mascot for Capital City. He was voiced by Tom Poston. His appearance seems to have been inspired by the mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, the Phillie Phanatic. The costume is a creature with a baseball body, with a blue Capital City T-Shirt, yellow arms and legs, a long flat-ended nose, tufts of fur at the side, a red hat with two springs, two costume eyes that look in either direction, and two more eyes that peek outside the mouth. The Capital City Goofball first appeared in the episode &quot; Dancin&apos; Homer &quot; and shared the stage with Homer. In &quot; Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade &quot;, the Capital City Goofball represents Capital City in the state legislature; he spent 80 million dollars out of his own pocket to win the seat, and now is leading an effort to change the state&apos;s embarrassing, Confederate-symbol centered state flag. With the death of Tom Poston in 2007, it is likely that this character will be retired, if the precedent regarding Phil Hartman and Doris Grau &apos;s characters (except for Lunchlady Doris, who is still used and is now voiced by Tress MacNeille ) is followed. He has not spoken since &quot; Bart and Lisa vs. the Third Grade &quot; and has been reduced to making minor background appearances and usual honking sounds. [ Captain Lance Murdock ] Captain Lance Murdock is a professional stunt devil who appeared more in the early days of the show rather than the newer episodes. He first appeared in &quot; Bart the Daredevil &quot; which featured him in more scenes than other episodes. He later appeared in &quot; I Married Marge &quot;, &quot; Selma&apos;s Choice &quot;, and &quot; Viva Ned Flanders &quot;. He was most recently featured when Krusty was flicking channels on his TV in &quot; Today I Am a Clown &quot;. He also appears in Lisa &apos;s lecture about Lake Springfield in The Simpsons Movie sitting in the audience. His signature bike is the suicycle and has his own action figure complete with ambulance. [ Charlie ] Charlie, voiced by Dan Castellaneta works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as the &apos;Dangerous Emissions Supervisor&apos;. He was briefly replaced by Mindy Simmons, but she got fired afterwards. His first appearance was in &quot; Life on the Fast Lane &quot;. He was briefly out of work due to a unnamed on-the-job injury, where he collected workers&apos; compensation, however future episodes show him back to work. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { King-Size Homer &quot; } { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer Goes to College &quot; } He has a wife and two kids { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer the Smithers &quot; } as well as a sister with a wooden leg. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer at the Bat &quot; } In &quot; The Trouble with Trillions &quot;, Charlie tells Homer (who is working undercover) that he has plans to overrun the American government due to their stalling on making HDTV available; he is soon arrested by FBI agents for conspiracy.

He is voiced by Hank Azaria. [ Cookie Kwan ] Cookie Kwan (voiced by Tress MacNeille ), is an Asian American real estate broker who first appears in the Season 9 Simpsons episode &quot; Realty Bites &quot;. She is the stereotypical competitive woman. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Realty Bites &quot; } She touts herself as being &quot; number one on the West Side &quot;, although she also works on the East Side. She is very aggressive toward anyone whom she deems a threat to her business, evidenced by when she threatens Gil Gunderson. She had once attempted to seduce Ned Flanders, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { A Star Is Born-Again &quot; } had an illegitimate baby with Mayor Quimby, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { She Used to Be My Girl &quot; } and flirted with Homer. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Large Marge &quot; } She is friends with Lindsey Naegle. She is a Republican. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { You Kent Always Say What You Want &quot; } She is played by MacNeille with a strong and harsh Asian accent. [ Corporal Punishment ] Corporal Punishment is a cast member on the Krusty the Clown show. He first appeared in the episode Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge as the enforcer for the show. He is a large man and is always seen in military uniform. [ Crazy Cat Lady ] Eleanor Abernathy { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { See Homer Run &quot; } (voiced by Tress MacNeille ), better known as the Crazy Cat Lady, is a woman with the appearance and behavior of a stereotypical mentally ill person. She first appears in &quot; Girly Edition &quot;. Abernathy is always surrounded by a large number of cats, and in every appearance she screams gibberish and/or throws cats at passersby. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Girly Edition. &quot; } She gives Lisa one of her cats, Snowball V, who looks exactly like her original Snowball II. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot &quot; } Abernathy has an unfortunate past. When she was eight, she was a smart and ambitious young girl who wanted to be both a lawyer and a doctor &quot; because a woman can do anything &quot;. She was studying for law school at 16, and by 24 she had earned a law degree from Yale Law School and a medical degree from Harvard Medical School. However, by 32, suffering from burnout, she had turned to alcohol and became obsessed with her pet cat. By the time she turned 40, she had assumed her present state as a drunken, raving lunatic. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Springfield Up &quot; } Abernathy briefly reverts to her sanity and high intelligence thanks to some pills that she shows the Simpsons, but after Marge points out that the pills are actually Reese&apos;s Pieces candy, Abernathy abruptly resumes her deranged behavior. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer and Ned&apos;s Hail Mary Pass &quot; } When participating in a mayoral election, she lucidly discusses topics such as health care, economy and public education in between her screams and gibberish. In the episode &quot; Eeny Teeny Maya Moe, &quot; Abernathy reveals that she once owned a cat with Moe Syzlak after he says that there &quot; Is a much creepier guy right next to me. &quot; from a public library computer. She yells &quot; You know I&apos;m a woman! &quot; and also that their cat had kittens; she then proclaims that &quot; These are yours! &quot; and insanely throws three cats at him.In the episode &quot; A Midsummer&apos;s Nice Dream, &quot; Abernathy is shown to be a hoarder.

Crusher&apos;s first appearance was in the second season episode &quot; Blood Feud &quot; where he is seen escorting Homer off the premises of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The two seem to be on first name terms as Homer calls him Joey. Their first appearance together was in the episode &quot; Last Exit to Springfield &quot; when the two of them kidnap Homer and take him to Burns Manor. They introduce themselves as &apos;Hired Goons&apos;, a term that Homer apparently is not familiar with. The pair rarely had speaking roles and were often used as Mr Burns&apos; goons for a number of early episodes but eventually they became background characters. [ Database ] Database, or Data, (real name unknown to viewers) is a nerd y student who attends Springfield Elementary School. He first appeared in the episode &quot; Bart&apos;s Comet &quot; as a member of &quot; the Super Friends &quot;. He has since had speaking parts in several episodes. He is usually seen with his fellow nerd Martin Prince. Database is a common target for Nelson, Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney. Database is part of the group of boys who invade Shelbyville in &quot; Lemon of Troy &quot;. He is one of the Pre-Teen Braves in the episode &quot; The Bart of War &quot;. He is a member of the school band, as seen in &quot; The PTA Disbands &quot;. Database is known for his annoying, nerdy voice which is supplied by Nancy Cartwright. Database&apos;s father is shown in &quot; Lemon of Troy &quot;, although he utters no dialogue and is only in the background and has not appeared since that episode. Matt Groening has stated that Database is his least favorite character in the show. { Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { Lemon of Troy &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season (DVD). 20th Century Fox. } [ Dave Shutton ] Dave Shutton, voiced by Harry Shearer, is a reporter for The Springfield Shopper. Writer John Swartzwelder named Shutton after a friend of his. { Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } His first appearance was in the season two episode &quot; Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish. &quot; Since then, his roles have become less relevant and have been reduced to cameos and appearances in crowd scenes. According to &quot; Who Shot Mr. Burns &quot;, Part 2, Kent Brockman does not like Dave Shutton and thinks he is unprofessional. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two) &quot; } { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Three Men and a Comic Book &quot; } { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { $pringfield &quot; } [ Declan Desmond ] Declan Desmond (voiced by Eric Idle of Monty Python fame) is an odd and skeptical British documentary filmmaker who has directed several films, including Do You Want Lies with That?, American Boneheads: A Day In The Life Of Springfield Elementary, Growing Up Springfield,Ain’t No Mountain: A Blind Man Climbs Everest and &quot; The Spy Who Learned Me &quot;. Growing Up Springfield is his most notable documentary. It follows the lives of the inhabitants of Springfield, starting when they were in third grade and continuing every eight years. It is a parody of Michael Apted ’s Up Series. Desmond appeared in the episodes &quot; &apos;Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky &quot; and &quot; Fat Man And Little Boy &quot; and his Growing Up Springfield series were featured in the episode &quot; Springfield Up &quot;. The character is based on real British filmmakers David Attenborough and Desmond Morris [ January 2009 ]. [ Dewey Largo ] Dewey Largo, voiced by Harry Shearer, is the music teacher, whom Lisa credited with proving that any piece of music could have the soul sucked out of it. He is very uncreative and is a poor, pathetic music conductor. He is always seen in the opening sequence, teaching his class and throwing Lisa out of his band class when she plays a funky/jazzy tune on her saxophone. His last name Largo is also an Italian word for a slow, broad musical tempo, a possible reference to the fact that he can make any piece of music uninteresting. He has not played a large role in the series, but was originally intended to be an uptight foil for Lisa, and her non-conformist ways. After the first few seasons, Mr. Largo was rarely seen. However he has since resurfaced as a recurring character in the seventeenth season, making appearances in several episodes. In the 17th season in the episode &quot; Homer&apos;s Paternity Coot &quot; it is revealed that Largo was accepted to the Juilliard School, but never got the letter as it was frozen atop Mount Springfield. He ended up at Springfield Elementary instead. A recurring gag since the 17th season episode &quot; See Homer Run &quot;, are allusions that Largo is gay. The 22nd season episode &quot; Flaming Moe &quot; confirmed Largo is gay and in a relationship with an older man. [ Disco Stu ] Disco Stu, real name Stuart Discotheque { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer Scissorhands &quot; } (voiced by Hank Azaria ) is a man who is mentally stuck in the disco era. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Two Bad Neighbors &quot; } He is normally featured wearing a rhinestone-encrusted leisure suit. Stu was introduced as the punchline to a joke in &quot; Two Bad Neighbors &quot;. In a garage sale, Homer attempts to sell a jacket on which he had once tried to write &quot; Disco Stud &quot; in rhinestone s, but having made the letters too big he did not have room for the final &quot; d &quot;. After Marge remarks that nobody would ever want to buy a jacket that read &quot; Disco Stu &quot;, another customer recommends it to Stu, but Stu replies, &quot; Disco Stu doesn&apos;t advertise. &quot; Stu&apos;s speech pattern is similar to that of Duffman, also voiced by Hank Azaria; he speaks in the third person, often referring to himself as &quot; Disco Stu &quot; (emphasizing &quot; Stu &quot; and then pausing before saying anything else; whatever follows usually rhymes with &quot; Stu &quot; ). According to &quot; How I Spent My Strummer Vacation &quot;, Stu actually is aware disco is dead, does not like disco music at all, and worries that his personality may make him a &quot; one-note guy &quot;. He is a Roman Catholic, having gotten an annulment from Pope John Paul II after a brief marriage to Selma Bouvier. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { How I Spent My Strummer Vacation &quot; } { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { How I Wet Your Mother &quot; } In the March 11th, 2012 episode &quot; How I Wet Your Mother &quot;, Professor Frink created a device that allowed people to enter the dreams of others. He stated he had already used the device &quot; To cure another Springfielder of his particular obsession &quot; at which point Stu walked into the frame in khakis and a collared shirt saying &quot; Normal Stu likes normal things. &quot; It is yet to be seen whether this transformation is permanent. Stu was originally to be voiced by repeat guest star Phil Hartman. However, when the animators remodeled the character, show runner Bill Oakley described the original Disco Stu as &quot; a black, wrinkly John Travolta &quot;, and Hartman was not available to dub the voice; Hank Azaria took over the role. { Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { Two Bad Neighbors &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Out of 25, IGN named Stu the 24th top peripheral character in The Simpsons.

He has light blue skin and wears a white laboratory coat, gloves and goggles. Doctor Colossus is a minor character and usually only appears in the background. He lives on &quot; Death Mountain &quot;. Doctor Colossus is often shown in jail, hinting that he is very incompetent as a supervillain. [ Dolph Starbeam ] Dolphin &quot; Dolph &quot; Starbeam, voiced by Tress MacNeille, is a bully and student at Springfield Elementary School. Dolph is recognized by his asymmetrical haircut which covers one eye and wears cutoff shorts and basketball shoes. He is left-handed and does not talk as much as the other bullies. He usually comes across as very intelligent and speaks a variety of languages including Esperanto, Swahili, and Klingon. It turns out Dolph is Jewish and attends Hebrew school. Despite the fact that he appears to be wholly Caucasian, in the episode &quot; Little Big Girl &quot; he shows up to multicultural day with a disked lower lip, suggesting some African or South American descent. He lied to his friends about not having a bar mitzvah, later claiming it had been &quot; just family &quot;. He has also mentioned the fact that he has two fathers. Dolph was named after one of Matt Groening&apos;s classmates from Lincoln High School named Dolph Timmerman. Groening stated that Timmerman was not a bully but just a real cool guy. [ Drederick Tatum ] Drederick Tatum (voiced by Hank Azaria ) has appeared in several episodes. He is a professional boxer and the reigning World Heavyweight Champion. He features prominently in the episode &quot; The Homer They Fall &quot;, in which Homer takes up boxing and is lined up as an opponent for Tatum, soon to be released from prison. The fight proves one-sided, and Homer is rescued by Moe just as he is about to be knocked out by Tatum. Tatum grew up in Springfield, but in &quot; Flaming Moe&apos;s &quot; he calls the city &quot; a dump &quot; and says &quot; if you ever see me back there, you know I really fu*#ed up bad! &quot; A former 1984 Olympic Gold medalist, he first became champion after defeating Watson in the heavily promoted &quot; Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out! &quot;, a fight Homer and his friends watched on his illegal cable hookup. He was so feared inside prison he could stop riots just by telling the rioters to shut up. Tatum also appears in &quot; Bye Bye Nerdie &quot;. Lisa tests her nerd spray on him, which forces Nelson Muntz to involuntarily get up and start punching Tatum, to little effect. A sobbing Nelson tries to apologise but Tatum rolls up his sleeves and declares &quot; you leave me little recourse! &quot; Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson, with a high-pitched lisping voice, a menacing demeanor, a criminal record, financial problems and a tendency to make pseudo-intellectual comments like &quot; I insist that you desist &quot; and &quot; your behavior is unconscionable &quot;. He also has an unscrupulous manager named Lucius Sweet, who closely resembles Tyson&apos;s promoter/manager Don King. Indeed, in &quot; The Homer They Fall &quot; Homer notes that Sweet &quot; is as rich and famous as Don King, and looks just like him &quot;. King and Tyson were asked to appear in the episode but declined. Paul Winfield, who played King in a 1995 Tyson biopic, took the role instead. [ Duffman ] Duffman, voiced by Hank Azaria, is a recurring character, who according to Turner, &quot; embodies all the self-importance and over-statement of contemporary marketing. &quot; [ Turner 2004 172 ] He is the mascot for the fictional Duff Corporation that sells Duff beer, [ Cochran Jennifer D. &quot; Mmmm...

Duffman is a muscular actor, dressed in a superhero costume who spouts slogans while he thrusts his hips. Duffman&apos;s thrusts were first acted out by Brad Bird. { Mentioned in the } { audio commentary for &quot; } { The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson &quot;. } His catchphrase comes from the song &quot; Oh Yeah &quot; by Yello, which the producers say became extremely popular after Ferris Bueller&apos;s Day Off and many advertisers started using it. As a result, the writers felt that the song and phrase &quot; Oh yeah! &quot; would be suitable for the character. [ Oakley, Bill 2006 Commentary for &quot; The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson &quot;. The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season DVD 20th Century Fox ] While usually loyal to his corporate sponsors, in the season 15 episode &quot; Co-Dependent&apos;s Day &quot;, Duffman reveals he is ashamed of betraying his Jew ish heritage by doing a Nazi-esque performance at Oktoberfest ( &quot; This reich will last a thousand beers! Oh, ja! [muttering]: I do this, and I&apos;m Jewish. &quot; ). In the season 17 episode &quot; Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play &quot;, it was revealed that there were two more Duffmen working. [ Eddie and Lou ] Eddie, voiced by Harry Shearer, and Lou, voiced by Hank Azaria, are Springfield police officers. They first appeared in the first season episode &quot; There&apos;s No Disgrace Like Home &quot;. { Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { There&apos;s No Disgrace Like Home &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The two do not have surnames, as Lou says &quot; we&apos;re like Cher &quot;; { The Simpsons episode: &quot; } { The Frying Game &quot; } in his younger years, Lou referred to himself as &quot; Lou the cop &quot;. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { That 90&apos;s Show &quot; } Lou is the police sergeant and a competent officer of the Springfield Police. He is a foil to Chief Wiggum, and often takes the time to point out Wiggum&apos;s mistakes. Lou has been shown to resent Wiggum, and is aware of his chief&apos;s ineptitude. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { I Don&apos;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings &quot; } Lou was married to a woman named Amy. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { The Dad Who Knew Too Little &quot; } In &quot; The Bart of War &quot;, it is shown that Lou is divorced from his wife, and Eddie has been seeing her occasionally. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { The Bart of War &quot; } Lou is a Democrat. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { E Pluribus Wiggum &quot;. } Al Jean and Mike Reiss named Lou after Major League Baseball player Lou Whitaker.

Commentary for &quot; } { Bart vs. Thanksgiving &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Elizabeth Hoover ] Elizabeth Hoover is a second grade teacher at Springfield Elementary, voiced by Maggie Roswell and Marcia Mitzman Gaven while Roswell was involved in a pay dispute. Miss Hoover has been worn down by her years in the public school system, and in Lisa Gets an &quot; A &quot; implies that she frequently drinks during lunch. In the episode Lisa&apos;s Substitute, she thought she had lyme disease. She is very apathetic and bored with her job, and seems overwhelmed with stress, seeking whatever remedies she can to alleviate it. She is often seen smoking even while teaching, once even under a &quot; No Smoking &quot; sign in the assembly hall. Her desperate attempts to regain her stability include rushing out of class to recite &quot; Calm blue ocean, calm blue ocean &quot; with her eyes closed, getting into her car and driving off on two occasions, and even letting Ralph teach the class when she was granted tenure. When the series began Miss Hoover&apos;s hair was pale blue, but from Season 4 onwards, she has had brown hair, presumably because of stress. [ March 2012 ] [ Fallout Boy ] In the series, Fallout Boy first appears in a 1950s Radioactive Man serial film shown at a comic book convention in the episode &quot; Three Men and a Comic Book. &quot; However, unlike many Simpsons characters, he has only made a handful of appearances since. While Radioactive Man is a broad parody of many superheroes, most obviously containing elements of Batman and Superman (and the comic incorporates an origin story similar to Marvel &apos;s Hulk ), among others, Fallout Boy is mainly a parody of Robin (with his costume, references as being the &apos;young ward&apos; of Radioactive Man, and his younger age and sidekick status) with elements of Spider-Man (his fictional comic book origin, for example). His catchphrase is &quot; Jiminy Jillickers! &quot; Additionally, Fallout Boy also appears in a real-life comic book titled Radioactive Man, published by Bongo Comics (a comic created in part by Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons). In these comic books, Fallout Boy&apos;s real name is Rod Runtledge, he has a brother named Dodd Runtledge, and they live in Zenith City. Rod is a high school nerd living with his aunt, Aunt June. Fallout Boy was an average book worm, until one day, he was at a Radioactive demonstration, where he met up with Claude Kane. A tall piece of machinery fell towards them. Claude grabbed Rod and jumped over the rail, Claude holding onto the machine. The machine came to life, and as the ray passed through Claude, who became Radioactive Man, it hit Rod. Rod then got a pint sized version of RM&apos;s powers, and became Fallout Boy. In the episode &quot; Radioactive Man &quot;, Milhouse was chosen over Bart to play Fallout Boy in the Radioactive Man movie to be filmed in Springfield. Rock band Fall Out Boy took the name of this character after, when they asked a concert audience what band name they should have, a fan shouted &quot; Fallout Boy! &quot; [ Frankie the Squealer ] Frankie the Squealer is a member of the Mafia and associate of Fat Tony. However, he does not appear to be very useful to his colleagues in criminal activity due to his uncontrollable habit of squealing (he claims that &quot; it makes [him] feel big &quot; ), even squealing on himself one time. On several occasions, the mob has attempted to kill him for his squealing, though they have repeatedly been unsuccessful. Frankie first appeared in episode &quot; Insane Clown Poppy &quot; where his squealing habits are introduced after he squeals on himself for squealing. [ Gil Gunderson ] Gil Gunderson, a.k.a. Ol&apos; Gil, voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared in the ninth season episode &quot; Realty Bites &quot; as a real estate agent with Lionel Hutz &apos;s Red Blazer Realty. { Scully, Mike (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { Realty Bites &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } He is a spoof of actor Jack Lemmon &apos;s portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 film adaptation of the play Glengarry Glen Ross. (Lemmon himself voiced a character similar to Levene in the eighth season episode &quot; The Twisted World of Marge Simpson &quot;.) { Weinstein, Josh (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { The Twisted World of Marge Simpson &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Show runner Mike Scully said that the writers thought that Gil would be &quot; a one-shot thing &quot;. { Scully, Mike (2006). He is seen working many different jobs in multiple epsisodes. Commentary for &quot; } { Natural Born Kissers &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } &quot; Dan Castellaneta was so funny at the table read doing the character &quot;, Scully elaborated, &quot; we kept making up excuses in subsequent episodes to put him in. &quot; Writer Dan Greaney said that it was a great take-off on Levene to make Gil more desperate than he was. Even so, the writers like to write Gil with &quot; a little bit of the old sparkle &quot; left in him. { Greaney, Dan (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { Realty Bites &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } With the retirement of the character Lionel Hutz (after voice actor Phil Hartman &apos;s death), Gil has been working as the Simpson&apos;s lawyer in later episodes. In 2006, &quot; Kill Gil, Volumes I &amp; II &quot;, the only episode to center on Gil, won a Writers Guild of America Award in the animation category. [ http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id%3D2764 2008 Writers Guild Awards Winners Announced -- 2008-02-09 WGAW ] [ Gloria ] Gloria, voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus is Snake &apos;s girlfriend. She is a meter maid. She first appears in &quot; A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love &quot;, dating Mr. Burns. She ends up leaving him to return to her ex-boyfriend Snake, for criticising but unintendedly complementing him in the same sentence. Gloria visits Snake in prison in &quot; I Don&apos;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. &quot; She appears once again in &quot; Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes &quot;, where she is now pregnant. However in &quot; Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words &quot; they have broken up. Then, in &quot; Wedding For Disaster &quot; they seem to have gotten back together and apparently got married. [ God ] God, voiced by Harry Shearer, has had many appearances in the series, including &quot; Homer the Heretic &quot;, &quot; Thank God, It&apos;s Doomsday &quot;, and a scene with Him, Buddha, and Colonel Sanders in &quot; Pray Anything &quot;, as well as appearing in the flick across the town in the opening sequence (in the HD episodes) where he is fighting with the devil. He is portrayed in the traditional depiction of the Abrahamic God : a gray-haired man in a white robe with a booming voice. In most episodes, only his beard is seen as the camera only films him up to the shoulders. His body is usually surrounded by a glowing light, and his robes float around him, though not always. He does not seem to be all-knowing. Another notable characteristic of him is his ability to forgive and tolerate Homer&apos;s mishaps, despite his later often heretical attitude. He is on good and even friendly terms with Homer, but he would not hesitate to severely punish him if Homer become too obnoxious. One of God&apos;s distinctive features is that he and Jesus are the only two Simpsons characters to be drawn with five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot, though not always. [ Grady and Julio ] Grady, voiced by Scott Thompson and Julio, voiced by Hank Azaria are two gay men who become Homer&apos;s roommates when he leaves Marge in &quot; Three Gays of the Condo &quot;. Julio reappears in &quot; There&apos;s Something About Marrying &quot;, marrying another man, in &quot; I Don&apos;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings &quot; as one of the bank robbery hostages, and has speaking cameos in &quot; Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind &quot; and &quot; E Pluribus Wiggum &quot;. He appeared in the episode &quot; Four Great Women and a Manicure &quot;, in which he was seen as &quot; King Julio &quot; in Lisa&apos;s first story, &quot; Elizabeth the First &quot;. He works as a photographer, as seen in &quot; The Devil Wears Nada &quot;. Grady made his second appearance to date in &quot; Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words &quot;, in which he persuades Homer to break up his (Grady&apos;s) relationship with Julio, so that he could pursue a relationship with Duffman. Julio made further appearances as Marge&apos;s Hairdresser in &quot; The Blue and the Gray &quot; and &quot; Homer Scissorhands &quot;. [ Gunter and Ernst ] Gunter and Ernst, Las Vegas-style entertainers voiced by Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria, are obvious parodies of Siegfried &amp; Roy : they speak with German accents, their act involves magic and white tiger s, and one has black hair while the other has bleached-blond hair. The duo appear in the episodes &quot; Viva Ned Flanders &quot;, &quot; $pringfield &quot;, &quot; The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons &quot;, and &quot; Jazzy and the Pussycats &quot;. In &quot; Jazzy and the Pussycats &quot;, they are seen at Amber Simpson&apos;s funeral. In &quot; The Simpsons Game &quot; it is revealed they performed at an aquarium. In a case of life imitating art, the 1993 episode &quot; $pringfield &quot; (the first episode featuring Gunter and Ernst) depicts the duo being savagely mauled by their trademark white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years later, the trained white tiger Montecore dragged Roy Horn off-stage by his neck during a performance at The Mirage. According to the DVD commentary on this episode on the Simpsons season five DVD set, the part where Gunter and Ernst get attacked is considered &quot; the greatest prediction &quot; the Simpsons ever made, but it was &quot; bound to happen &quot; considering how the tiger was treated. [ The Happy Little Elves ] The Happy Little Elves are a parody of The Smurfs, who appeared more often in the show&apos;s earlier episodes. They are a favorite of Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Bart, however, hates them; he mainly refers to them as either &quot; those stupid elves &quot; &quot; The Crappy Little Elves &quot;, or &quot; The Little Green Idiots &quot;. Their movies include Return of the Happy Little Elves, an unnamed Christmas movie as seen in &quot; Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire &quot;, The Happy Little Elves Meet The Curious Bear Cubs, The Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town, and The Happy Little Elves meet Fuzzy Snuggleduck (which was listed as an R-rated movie along with Thelma &amp; Louise and The Erotic Awakening of S on Rancho Relaxo&apos;s cable system). They were first mentioned in a short on The Tracey Ullman Show entitled &quot; Scary Movie &quot;. The most recent appearance they had was in &quot; Lisa Simpson, This Isn&apos;t Your Life &quot; in November 2010. In more current episodes, they appear as wall decorations in Maggie&apos;s and Lisa&apos;s rooms. [ Helen Lovejoy ] Helen Lovejoy (née Schwartzbaum), voiced by Maggie Roswell and Marcia Mitzman Gaven, is Rev. Lovejoy ’s judgmental and gossip y wife, and the mother of Jessica Lovejoy. She introduced herself in the episode &quot; Life on the Fast Lane &quot; as &quot; the gossipy wife of the minister. &quot; Her catchphrase is &quot; What about the children?! Won&apos;t somebody &apos;&apos;please&apos;&apos; think of the children !? &quot; which she always says among a crowd when something bad is happening in the city. In &quot; Wedding for Disaster &quot;, the Parson remarks to Reverend Lovejoy that he remembers when Helen Lovejoy was Helen Schwartzbaum and prior to that, Harold Schwartzbaum, before deciding he has said too much, implying that Helen was not always a woman, however this is directly contradicted as in flashbacks she is shown to be a girl as a child, and the fact that she and Reverend Lovejoy have a biological daughter in Jessica. In E Pluribus Wiggum, it was revealed that Helen is a member of the Springfield Republican Caucus while in one of their dungeon meetings. In the Treehouse of Horror XX, she is revealed to be Lisa&apos;s Godmother. [ Herman ] Herman Larson, voiced by Harry Shearer, is the owner of Herman&apos;s Military Antiques. He is a right-arm above-elbow amputee; he tells Bart that the arm was lost when he stuck it out the window of a moving bus as a kid. A brilliant military tactician, Herman was instrumental in Bart’s victory in water balloon combat against Nelson and in the negotiation of the peace treaty between the two combatants in &quot; Bart the General &quot;, which is his most significant and first appearance. He is friends with Abraham Simpson, to whom he sold a fez, claiming it was previously owned by Napoleon; Herman then advertised Abe&apos;s old hat as &quot; the hat McKinley was shot in &quot;. He also tried to sell counterfeit jeans out of the Simpsons&apos; garage, but was foiled by Marge Simpson. He once captured Chief Wiggum and Snake and held them hostage, but was accidentally knocked out by Milhouse with a medieval mace, rescuing them. Harry Shearer does an impression of George H.W. Bush for the voice. { Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { Bart the General &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Herman&apos;s facial appearance is modeled after Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder. The original idea behind Herman, said Groening, was that each time he appeared, he would give a different explanation for how he lost his arm. However, the second joke, involving Herman having stuck his arm in a ball return at a bowling alley, got cut, and the writers never pursued the idea. { Groening, Matt (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { Treehouse of Horror VIII &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Janey Powell ] Janey Powell, voiced by Pamela Hayden, is a classmate and friend of Lisa Simpson. Janey first appeared in &quot; Bart the General &quot; and was once Lisa&apos;s closest friend. She has been at Lisa&apos;s sleepover s, and Lisa is seen watching cartoons at her house on numerous occasions. Her description on The Simpsons POG set described her as &quot; Lisa&apos;s fair-weather friend &quot;. Though she is sometimes seen spending time with Lisa, other times she teases her along with the other children. She is not portrayed as being nearly as intelligent or nerdy as Lisa. Janey may have had a crush on Milhouse Van Houten, who has a crush on Lisa. She enjoys reading babysitting books. [ Jasper Beardly ] Jasper Beardly, voiced by Harry Shearer is one of the elder residents of Springfield, often portrayed as Abraham Simpson &apos;s best friend. His most distinguishing features are his ultra-low, gravelly voice and very long beard. Jasper made his first appearance in &quot; Homer&apos;s Odyssey &quot;. He is a veteran of World War II, but (according to the episode &quot; Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play &quot; ) he attempted to avoid the draft by disguising himself as a woman. He stayed in Springfield to play in the local women&apos;s baseball league, along with his friend Abe, who was also avoiding the war but was exposed during a game. In a deleted scene, it was shown that Jasper was the town pastor, prior to Reverend Lovejoy. He briefly served as substitute teacher of Lisa&apos;s class during which time he confiscated everything made of tin, got his beard caught in a pencil sharpener and threatened paddling for minor infractions such as looking out the window or talking out of turn. In the subplot of the season nine episode, &quot; Lisa the Simpson &quot;, Jasper put himself in crude &quot; suspended animation &quot; in the Kwik-E-Mart &apos;s freezer, and under advice from Dr. Nick Riviera, Apu kept him frozen. When Jasper&apos;s frozen form became popular with customers, Apu started exploiting the spectacle, and transformed the Kwik-E-Mart into a special interest store dealing with weird items, or perfectly ordinary ones which had been made out to be abnormal, called the Freak-E-Mart. Jasper was accidentally unfrozen, and stepped out into what he thought was a future world, just as Apu was considering selling him to the Rich Texan. In the episode &quot; I Don&apos;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings &quot; Jasper mentions he is a diabetic. [ Jebediah Springfield ] Jebediah Obadiah Zachariah Jedediah Springfield (a.k.a. Hans Sprungfeld) is the founder of the town of Springfield. He is voiced by Harry Shearer. According to legend, Jebediah Springfield and his partner Shelbyville Manhattan, led a band that left Maryland in search of &quot; New Sodom &quot; due to a misinterpretation of the Bible, but they parted ways over political differences: though both men are devoted to chastity and abstinence, Manhattan wanted to let people be free to marry their cousins if they wish, to which Springfield strongly opposes. It was then Manhattan went on to found the rival town of Shelbyville, taking half of the settlers with him. Springfield had many famous quotations, such as &quot; A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man &quot;. He also wears a coonskin cap. The Springfield Marathon commemorates an occasion on which he ran across six states in order to avoid his creditors. In &quot; The Telltale Head &quot; Bart beheaded the statue, thinking that this would make him more popular. In reality, the town became depressed and angry, leaving Bart to endure &quot; The Tell-Tale Heart &quot; -style guilt before replacing it. This episode is referenced in multiple Simpsons video games such as The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants, where the statue&apos;s head serves as a power-up item, or The Simpsons Road Rage and The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run, where characters can kick or ram Jebediah&apos;s head off the statue. Many Jebediah legends have been debunked during the run of the series. For instance, &quot; The Telltale Head &quot; repeatedly refers to Jebediah killing a bear with his bare hands, but on the news, Kent Brockman reveals that recent historical evidence suggests the bear actually killed Jebediah. On an expedition to Springfield&apos;s historic &quot; Fort Springfield &quot;, Bart uncovers other inconsistencies in the Jebediah legend, such as that he fought at Fort Ticonderoga the same day as the first Whacking Day. Most of Springfield&apos;s biography is revealed in the 1996 episode &quot; Lisa the Iconoclast &quot;, wherein Lisa Simpson discovers Jebediah Springfield&apos;s biggest secret: he was formerly a bloodthirsty pirate named Hans Sprungfeld, who once brawled with George Washington and lost after Washington crushed Sprungfeld&apos;s genitals in one of his sets of iron false teeth. Sprungfeld fled and changed his name in 1795 to hide his identity. He was well known for his &quot; silver tongue &quot; (literally; a metal prosthetic tongue, his original tongue having been bitten off by a Turkish pirate in a grog house fight). Before he died of diphtheria, he wrote his confession on a scrap of canvas that he hid in a fife. The canvas scrap formed the &quot; missing piece &quot; of the famously incomplete 1796 Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington; Sprungfeld picked it up during a fight against Washington which occurred while the latter was having his portrait painted. Lisa decides not to reveal this secret to the people of Springfield, seeing that the myth of Jebediah has brought out the good in everyone and that the true story will cause them to lose hope and morale within themselves. The Australian rock-band &quot; Jebediah &quot; was named after Jebediah Springfield. [ Jimbo Jones ] Corky James &quot; Jimbo &quot; Jones, voiced by Pamela Hayden and originally by Tress MacNeille in his first appearance in the first season episode &quot; The Telltale Head &quot; is a lowlife who wears a purple knit cap and a black T-shirt emblazoned with a menacing skull. He can often be seen hanging around Kearney, Dolph, and sometimes Nelson. He is generally acknowledged as the leader of this clique. He enjoys intimidating his schoolmates and shoplifting. It is hinted that he comes from a well-off family, most notably in season six&apos;s &quot; The PTA Disbands &quot; when  — with the school closed for a teacher&apos;s strike - he and his mother watch soap opera s and sip tea together in a very nice living room. In season seven&apos;s Bart the Fink, Bart discovers that Jimbo&apos;s real name is Corky. Jimbo&apos;s other known aliases are Jamesbo, Dr. J and Hector Gutierrez. Jimbo is named for executive producer James L. Brooks. { Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { The Telltale Head &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Jimbo runs for mayor in the Season 17 episode &quot; See Homer Run &quot;, with a campaign slogan of &quot; Tough on Nerds. Tougher on Dorks. &quot; [ Johnny Tightlips ] Johnny &quot; John &quot; Tightlips, voiced by Hank Azaria, is a member of the Mafia and associate of Fat Tony. He says very little, which spares him from accusations of being a &quot; squealer &quot;, but his reticence tends to be unhelpful to others and even himself. In &quot; The Twisted World of Marge Simpson &quot; he tries to help Fat Tony in taking away Marge&apos;s earnings from her &apos;Pretzel Wagon&apos; franchise. In &quot; Insane Clown Poppy &quot;, there is a shoot-out in Fat Tony&apos;s mansion and Tightlips is shot by accident. When asked where he&apos;s injured, he says &quot; I ain&apos;t sayin&apos; nuthin&apos;! &quot;, and when asked what to tell the doctor he says, &quot; Tell him to suck a lemon. &quot; [ http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF17 Insane Clown Poppy The Simpsons Archive 2008-04-12 ] [ Jub-Jub ] Jub-Jub is Selma Bouvier &apos;s pet iguana and was originally owned by Aunt Gladys. It was first seen in &quot; Selma&apos;s Choice &quot;. Gladys gives Jub-Jub to Jacqueline Bouvier, who is highly unattached to it. As a result, she later passes it on to Selma. Selma once said that Jub-Jub will eat her remains upon her death. The name Jub-Jub was coined by then-writer Conan O&apos;Brien. [ Stern, David 2004 The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Selma&apos;s Choice &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] He often said nonsensical things around the office for no apparent reason, one of which was &quot; Jub-Jub &quot;. (There is, however, a Jubjub bird in The Hunting of the Snark.) Fans of Sportsradio 1310 in Dallas voted that Jub-Jub be the new nickname of morning radio host George Dunham. O&apos;Brien, on October 17, 2007, mentioned his creation of Jub Jub and asked Joe Buck, the play-by-play commentator of the MLB World Series on FOX, to say it during his broadcast. O&apos;Brien promised $1,000.00 to the charity of the announcer&apos;s choice. On October 24, 2007, during Game 1 of the 2007 World Series, Buck called field level reporter, Chris Myers, &quot; our own little Jub-Jub. &quot; Jub-Jub was used as the first Twitter hash tag for O&apos;Brien&apos;s &quot; Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour &quot; in 2010. [ Judge Constance Harm ] Judge Constance Harm, voiced by repeat guest star actress Jane Kaczmarek, is a harsh, unforgiving disciplinarian. { The Simpsons &quot; } { The Parent Rap &quot; - November 4, 2001 } She enjoys creating cruel punishments for criminals in her court and frightening them with a miniature guillotine on the bench. She might be a transsexual based on a statement she makes during her first appearance in &quot; The Parent Rap &quot; : &quot; you remind me of me, when I was a little boy &quot;. Her name is a play on &quot; constant harm &quot;. The character is a parody of Judge Judy. In &quot; On a Clear Day I Can&apos;t See My Sister &quot;, she reveals she has a husband. Although Judge Snyder resolves court cases, Judge Harm has mainly been used for handing down negative verdicts, such as sentencing a family member to prison. She also appears in &quot; Brawl in the Family &quot;, &quot; Barting Over &quot;, &quot; The Wandering Juvie &quot;, &quot; Brake My Wife, Please &quot; and &quot; Chief of Hearts &quot;. { The Simpsons &quot; } { Brake My Wife, Please &quot; - May 11, 2003 } [ Judge Snyder ] Judge Roy Snyder, voiced by Harry Shearer, { Gimple, p. 87 } is a Springfield judge known for his lenient punishments and somewhat unorthodox rulings (as in the episode &quot; Sweets and Sour Marge, &quot; when he bans sugar from Springfield). The character was originally named &quot; Judge Moulton &quot;, but show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein did not know that, and called him &quot; Snyder &quot;. { Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { The Day the Violence Died &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } His appearance is modeled on Robert Bork. Snyder&apos;s skin color has gone back and forth between yellow and brown repeatedly throughout the series. { Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { Krusty Gets Busted &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ &quot; Just Stamp the Ticket &quot; Man ] This man first appears in &quot; When Flanders Failed &quot; when he goes to the Leftorium to get his parking validated because it is the only store that does it without requiring a purchase. Ned Flanders says he is &quot; right as rain, or, as we say around here, &apos;left as rain&apos; but the man bluntly responds &quot; Just stamp the ticket. &quot; His next appearances is in &quot; Homer Alone &quot;, when the Squeaky Voiced Teen tries to hand him a flyer he brushes him off by saying &quot; Don&apos;t touch me &quot;. In a later episode, &quot; Mr. Plow &quot;, he tells Barney Gumble (who is handing out flyers dressed as Lullabuy$&apos;s Big Baby) that he &quot; sickens &quot; him. He reappears again in Homer&apos;s Barbershop Quartet, at the Springfield Swap Meet, he derides Marge &apos;s &quot; cool &quot; wishbone necklaces, stating he doubted his &quot; son or daughter is that stupid &quot;. The character also appears in the episodes &quot; Homer Loves Flanders &quot;, &quot; Homer and Apu &quot;, &quot; Bart of Darkness &quot; (in which he punched a hippie for singing &quot; Sunshine On My Shoulders &quot; ) and &quot; Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy &quot;. [ Dr. J. Loren Pryor ] Dr. J. Loren Pryor, voiced by Harry Shearer, is the school psychologist. He is based on an early design for Seymour Skinner, and first appears in &quot; Bart the Genius &quot; where he decides to send Bart to a school for gifted children after Bart cheats on a test. Bart later approaches him to request returning to Springfield Elementary. In &quot; Bart Gets an F &quot;, he tells Bart that he may have to repeat the fourth grade. He appears again, discussing Bart&apos;s problems at school and Lisa&apos;s special gift in a flashback sequence of &quot; Lisa&apos;s Sax &quot;. In this episode he also inadvertently reveals that Milhouse Van Houten possesses &quot; flamboyantly homosexual &quot; tendencies. Pryor does not appear again for several years until the episode &quot; See Homer Run &quot;, in which he tells Lisa that she is going through a developmental condition. [ Kearney Zzyzwicz ] Kearney Zzyzwicz, voiced by Nancy Cartwright, is one of Springfield Elementary&apos;s many bullies. He has a buzz cut, and wears a torn white T-shirt, blue shorts, and studded wristbands. Although he looks and sounds to be around Jimbo or Dolph &apos;s age, Kearney is actually older. He is the only Springfield Elementary School student who remembers the Watergate Scandal and the 1976 Bicenntenial (according to Principal Skinner), was in Otto the bus driver&apos;s third-grade class (according to Otto), owns a car (even though he rode the school bus on &quot; A Milhouse Divided &quot;, &quot; The Mook, the Chef, the Wife, and Her Homer &quot;, and &quot; How the Test Was Won &quot; ), regularly shaves, has custody of a child from a divorce, is old enough to vote in a general U.S. election, was sent to prison, and pays taxes. In &quot; She of Little Faith &quot;, Kearney dated Jimbo&apos;s mother. In the same episode, it is revealed that he is on the church council of the First Church of Springfield and is &quot; a teenager and the parent of a teenager &quot;. [ She of Little Faith She of Little Faith The Simpsons The Simpsons 2001-12-16 13 6 ] Kearney often relies on (or tricks) Homer into procuring alcohol for himself and his friends (as seen in &quot; The Springfield Connection &quot;, &quot; Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious &quot;, and &quot; Last Tap Dance in Springfield &quot; ), and once used a fake ID (as seen in &quot; Much Apu About Nothing &quot; ), though it is heavily implied that Kearney is of the legal age to buy alcohol for himself (as in &quot; El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer &quot;, in which he is seen drinking at Moe&apos;s Tavern ). Kearney&apos;s last name (Zzyzwicz) was revealed in a computer file in season 18&apos;s &quot; 24 Minutes &quot;. Prior to that episode, Kearney&apos;s surname was never mentioned. In &quot; Bart Gets a &apos;Z&apos; &quot;, Kearney can be seen sitting in the back row of Bart&apos;s classroom, implying that Kearney is a fourth grader. Kearney&apos;s father was shown on the season eight episode &quot; The Homer They Fall &quot;, but in &quot; O Brother, Where Bart Thou? &quot;, Kearney reveals that both of his parents are incarcerated and they only meet when the prison and insane asylum have their annual mixer. [ Kirk Van Houten ] Kirk Van Houten is voiced by Hank Azaria. He is the father of Milhouse, and the remarried husband of Luann Van Houten. He wears glasses just like his son and wife. He first appeared in &quot; Bart&apos;s Friend Falls in Love &quot;. Kirk has been portrayed as a stereotypical middle-aged male loser and deadbeat dad. Much of his character revolves around his extreme emotional depression after his divorce from his wife Luann. Luann got custody of Milhouse when they divorced, but Kirk has visiting rights and is often seen with Milhouse in later episodes. Kirk suffers from the need to cry all the time after his divorce, even in good times. The Van Houtens remarried in the nineteenth season episode &quot; Little Orphan Millie &quot;. In that episode it was established that Kirk is of Dutch and Danish ancestry. Kirk previously served in the U.S. Army, and attended Gudger College. Apparently Kirk&apos;s mother is of Greek ancestry, based on the nineteenth season episode &quot; Husbands and Knives &quot;. In the episode, Milhouse says, &quot; But that&apos;s the money Yaya Sophia gave me for Greek Orthodox Easter! &quot;. According to Luann, Kirk was not a very good provider, and she had to borrow money from her sister to make ends meet. When Luann demands a divorce, Kirk is all too happy to oblige. Unfortunately, he loses his middle-management job at Southern Cracker, a job given to him by Luann&apos;s father, as a result. Kirk briefly attempts a career as a singer-songwriter, recording a demo tape of an original song titled &quot; Can I Borrow A Feeling &quot;, with mediocre results. Later, he attempts to win Luann back by singing the song to her. Luann does not reciprocate Kirk&apos;s feelings, choosing instead to remain with her boyfriend. Kirk reveals in the episode &quot; I Am Furious Yellow &quot;, where he visits his son&apos;s school on career day, that he was currently employed as an assistant to the guy who puts fliers under people&apos;s windshield wipers. Kirk also had a job standing on the curb holding a sign directing people to a condo development and worked as a scarecrow protecting a soy-bean crop, which resulted in his eye being gouged by a crow. Since being fired from the cracker company, Kirk seems to be unable to maintain a steady job. He once shouted at Luann that she had to keep up the alimony payments she owed him, and he has been seen at the Springfield unemployment office, perhaps suggesting that alimony and unemployment benefits are his only steady sources of income. Kirk was put in jail in the episode &quot; Pranksta Rap &quot; for &quot; kidnapping &quot; Bart which he greatly enjoyed due to him being envied by women and fed three meals a day. In The Simpsons Movie, Kirk is briefly seen attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. [ Laura Powers ] Laura Powers, voiced by Sara Gilbert is the teenage daughter of Ruth Powers. Her first and only appearance is in the episode &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot; when she and Ruth move in next door to the Simpsons. When Marge and Homer ask her to babysit Bart, Lisa and Maggie, Bart immediately develops a crush on her. However he is shocked to find out that she is dating local bully Jimbo Jones whom she later breaks up with after Moe threatens to kill Jimbo over a prank call that Bart made. Ruth mentions Laura in &quot; Marge On The Lam &quot; when Ruth tells Marge that she has to head home before her daughter watches &quot; that naked talk show. &quot; [ Legs and Louie ] Legs, voiced by Karl Wiedergott (formerly voiced by Hank Azaria ), and Louie, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, are the two Springfield Mafia hitmen who accompany Fat Tony at all times. The two lack any real definitive characteristic and are almost always seen together. Legs has a dark blonde short haircut and raspy voice. Louie has a slight black afro and a more high-pitched, even squeaky tone. Castellaneta based the voice on actor Joe Pesci, one of the several references to Goodfellas used in the episode &quot; Bart the Murderer &quot;. { Castellaneta, Dan (2009). Commentary for &quot; } { Insane Clown Poppy &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Louie says that tear gas is &quot; [his] one weakness, &quot; though this is likely an embellishment. Dan Castellaneta was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 2011 for the voice of Louie, Homer Simpson, Barney Gumble, and Krusty the Clown thanks to the episode Donnie Fatso.

He is a large, surly, snarling man who frequently speaks through clenched teeth, and is one of the few characters on The Simpsons to have eyebrow s. When Principal Skinner has to be temporarily replaced, Leopold stomps in, issues several threats, and terrifies the children by making them think he is the replacement, and then suddenly politely introduces the actual substitute, Ned Flanders. The children then collectively sigh with relief. The gag was repeated when Marge Simpson becomes a substitute teacher in the episode &quot; The PTA Disbands &quot;. Leopold often refers to the children of Springfield Elementary as &quot; little freaks. &quot; [ http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F18.html [1F18] Sweet Seymour Skinner&apos;s Baadasssss Song 2008-03-01 Cherry James A. 1996-07-21 Episode transcript The Simpsons Archive (snpp.com) ] [ http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F19.html [2F19] The PTA Disbands 2008-03-01 Cherry James A. 1997-02-22 Episode transcript The Simpsons Archive (snpp.com) ] [ Lewis ] Lewis Jackson is an African American character, and student at Springfield Elementary School in Bart&apos;s class. He can be seen playing the bassoon in the opening sequence of the show. Although one of the most minor characters in the show, Lewis appears frequently in scenes involving the Springfield children, and occasionally speaks. He is usually seen with Richard. While Lewis has never had significant dialogue, he has been voiced by Nancy Cartwright, Jo Ann Harris, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille, and Russi Taylor throughout the series. Lewis&apos;s seeming insignificance to the show is underscored in the episode &quot; Das Bus &quot;, in which Bart mistakenly calls him &quot; Wendell &quot;. [ Lindsey Naegle ] Lindsey Naegle is voiced by Tress MacNeille and first appeared in the eighth season episode &quot; The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show &quot;. { McCann, p. 88 } In that episode, she had no name and was known only as &quot; The Generic Female TV Executive &quot;. She appeared again in &quot; Girly Edition &quot;, also as a generic female TV executive (only her hair and facial features differed from her first appearance). { Gimple, p. 37 } In &quot; They Saved Lisa&apos;s Brain &quot;, she was introduced as &quot; Lindsey Naegle &quot;, a member of the Springfield Chapter of Mensa, and has since become a recurring character. The writers modeled Naegle on a number of network executives that they have encountered while working on the show. { Weinstein, Josh (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The character gets her last name from Hollywood talent agent Sue Naegle, president of HBO Entertainment and wife of Simpsons writer Dana Gould. { Selman, Matt (2007).

Naegle prototypes have appeared throughout the series, such as the OmniTouch Rep from &quot; Make Room for Lisa &quot; and Laramie executive Mindy from &quot; E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt) &quot;. { Turner, p. 167 } In &quot; Blame It on Lisa &quot;, it is revealed that she frequently changes jobs because she is a sexual predator. Chris Turner, author of the book Planet Simpson, called Naegle &quot; an excellent allegory for the modern corporate age: you don&apos;t see through her because there&apos;s nothing else to see. &quot; { Turner, p. 168 } Her political allegiances are not concrete: In &quot; You Kent Always Say What You Want, &quot; she is shown at the Republican Party headquarters; in &quot; E Pluribus Wiggum, &quot; Naegle is conversely depicted as a Democrat. [ Lois Pennycandy ] Lois Pennycandy is the beautiful executive assistant to Krusty the Clown. { &quot; } { Like Father, Like Clown &quot; } She swayed Krusty into visiting Bart after he saved Krusty from jail time, { &quot; } { Krusty Gets Busted &quot; } and later reunited him with his estranged father the Rabbi Hyman Krustofski. She was at Krusty&apos;s side during the auditions in which Robert Terwilliger became Krusty&apos;s new sidekick, { &quot; } { Brother from Another Series &quot; } and was at Krusty&apos;s &quot; funeral &quot; when he was presumed dead after crashing his private plane into a cliff. { &quot; } { Bart the Fink &quot; } In a phone conversation, Marge once asked her, &quot; How can [Krusty] hurt someone who loves him so? &quot; While looking at a framed photo of Krusty, Pennycandy replied, &quot; Oh, Mrs. Simpson, I&apos;ve wasted my womanhood asking that same question. &quot; Her only speaking roles are in &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot; and &quot; Krusty Gets Kancelled &quot;, in which she was voiced by Pamela Hayden. [ Luann Van Houten ] Luann Van Houten is voiced by Maggie Roswell. When Roswell left the show in 1998, she became a primarily nonspeaking character. However, Roswell returned in 2002. Since the season 8 episode, &quot; A Milhouse Divided &quot;, Luann was depicted as a promiscuous, single mother, who stuck her successful love life in the face of her ex-husband, Kirk. She first appeared in &quot; Homer Defined &quot;. She wears glasses, a trait that she shares with her husband and son. Luann Van Houten&apos;s mother is Italian. She was born in Shelbyville, and moved to Springfield in early life. It is stated in &quot; A Milhouse Divided &quot; that she has a sister. Luann was married to Kirk for several years, giving birth to a son, Milhouse, yet the marriage was an unhappy one. After an argument over a game of Pictionary, she leaves Kirk after he remarks he can&apos;t draw &quot; dignity &quot;, since he gave it up when he married her. Although Kirk found the new liberty of a single life tough, Luann uses her newfound freedom to live life on the fast lane. Luann began dating American Gladiator Pyro shortly after her divorce with Kirk for several seasons, but was caught cheating on him with his best friend, Gyro. In Apu Nahasapeemapetilon &apos;s bachelor years, she had been one of his bachelorettes. In &quot; Milhouse of Sand and Fog &quot;, it is revealed that Luann had also gone out with Disco Stu as well and had begun a relationship with Sea Captain. In &quot; Milhouse of Sand and Fog &quot; the Van Houtens reunited. Since then, they are often seen together (although in the episode &quot; Ice Cream of Margie (with the Light Blue Hair) &quot;, Kirk was seen with Milhouse at a single father&apos;s outing, showing he and Luann were still not married). As of &quot; Little Orphan Millie &quot;, they are remarried.She And Kirk Had A Little Appearance In &quot; Moe Goes From Rags To Riches &quot; [ Luigi Risotto ] Luigi Risotto, voiced by Hank Azaria, { Gimple, p. 86 } is the proprietor of Luigi&apos;s, a Springfield Italian restaurant. He is a parody of the &quot; Italian pasta/pizza chef &quot; stereotype (and in fact is on a bowling team called &quot; The Stereotypes &quot; along with Cletus Spuckler, Captain Horatio McCallister, and Groundskeeper Willie ), but seems to be aware of his status as a stock character. He is polite to his customers and treats them with respect when they order and then loudly insults and belittles them to his cook Salvatore, apparently unaware that they can hear him from the kitchen. In the episode &quot; The Last of the Red Hat Mamas, &quot; he reveals that he does not speak Italian. It is hinted that Luigi is an illegal immigrant, even though he tried to run for mayor, telling Springfielders, &quot; I make-a you the good government, just how-a you like it! &quot; The animators copied Luigi&apos;s appearance from a chef that was on the front of a pizza box. { Mirkin, David (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Sweet Seymour Skinner&apos;s Baadasssss Song &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Lunchlady Doris ] Lunchlady Doris Freedman, voiced by Doris Grau up until her death, and now voiced by Tress MacNeille, is a sardonic chef for Springfield Elementary. She can frequently be seen serving deeply unpleasant meals, such as animal genitalia and ground up gym mats, because of the school budget cutbacks. She has also made a handful of appearances acting as a school nurse, apparently due to budget cutbacks. In the episode Team Homer it is suggested that she is the mother of Jeremy Freedman (a.k.a. the Squeaky-voiced Teen ). After Grau&apos;s death in 1995, Lunchlady Doris was retired out of respect for over 10 years. Due to the delay between recording some episodes and the time they actually air, Grau&apos;s voice was included in episodes airing as late as 1997 such as &quot; Lisa&apos;s Sax &quot;. [ http://snpp.com/guides/doris.html The Simpsons Archive: The Lunchlady Doris File Snpp.com 2005-08-28 2011-10-23 ] Lunchlady Doris is seen as a silent background character until she speaks in the 18th season during &quot; The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer &quot;, where she is voiced by Tress MacNeille, season 19&apos;s &quot; The Debarted &quot;, where she is again voiced by Tress MacNeille but with a different voice, and season 20&apos;s &quot; Father Knows Worst &quot;. [ Lurleen Lumpkin ] Lurleen Lumpkin (voiced by Beverly D&apos;Angelo ) is an aspiring country singer who is managed by Homer in &quot; Colonel Homer &quot;. Homer discovers her in a redneck bar in the middle of nowhere and is amazed by her voice. He decides to help her launch a singing career, much to the chagrin of Marge. Grateful for Homer&apos;s help, Lurleen becomes attracted to him and tries to lure him with an erotic song called &quot; Bunk with Me Tonight &quot;. Homer, who had been ignorant of this, suddenly realizes that managing Lurleen could hurt his marriage, so he quits as her manager. A saddened Lurleen sings a song called &quot; Stand By Your Manager &quot;. Lurleen&apos;s next appearance is in &quot; Krusty Gets Kancelled &quot;, in which she is briefly seen in the center square of Springfield Squares. In an earlier episode, &quot; Marge vs. the Monorail &quot;, a much rougher-looking Lurleen, voiced by Doris Grau, makes a brief appearance, in which it is revealed that she had been to the Betty Ford Clinic and &quot; spent last night in a ditch &quot;. In this episode her voice sounds exactly the same as Lunchlady Doris &apos;s, rather than her soft, Southern voice she had when she was first introduced. The nineteenth season episode &quot; Papa Don&apos;t Leech &quot; { IGN TV tv.ign.com. Retrieved July 29, 2007. } follows up on her story with her moving into the Simpsons&apos; home and taking a waitress job at Moe&apos;s in order to pay a $12 million tax bill. It is revealed she has a father named Royce Boss Hogg Lumpkin, who was never much supportive of her and had been missing for years. Marge undertakes efforts to find him and reunite him with Lurleen. As soon as it happens, Lurleen writes a new, upbeat composition called &quot; Daddy&apos;s Back &quot;, but Royce sells the song, taking the writing credits for himself (but altering some lyrics), to the Dixie Chicks. As soon as she learns of this, Lurleen confronts Royce and reveals the truth to the Dixie Chicks, who assault him with their musical instruments and invite Lurleen to join their tour. Lurleen ends up engaged to a man who looks very much like Homer (like her previous husbands did) and tours as an opening act for the Dixie Chicks. [ Dr. Marvin Monroe ] Dr. Marvin Monroe is a psychotherapist who first appeared in the first season episode &quot; There&apos;s No Disgrace Like Home &quot;. Homer pawns the family television in order to afford a session with Monroe for him and his dysfunctional family. The failed attempt at therapy culminates with the Simpsons electroshocking each other endlessly, to the point of causing a blackout. Unable to help the Simpsons, Monroe refunds double what the Simpsons paid, and the Simpsons buy a new TV. Monroe appears in &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot; in which 70% of that episode&apos;s original animation had to be redone, although the scenes involving Monroe were mostly untouched, said co-director David Silverman. { Silverman, David (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { Some Enchanted Evening &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The script of &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot; describes Monroe as &quot; a heavy, chain-smoking, compulsive eater. &quot; { Script for &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The original idea behind the character, said Matt Groening, was that he was born Marilyn Monroe and was &quot; very caught up over that &quot;, which is why he became a therapist. { Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Monroe&apos;s voice is based on psychiatrist David Viscott &apos;s. { Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { There&apos;s No Disgrace Like Home &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Among Monroe&apos;s works is Dr. Marvin Monroe&apos;s Guide to Etiquette, which Bart receives as a birthday gift in &quot; Radio Bart &quot;. Since the seventh season, the character Monroe has been retired. This is because voicing the character strained Harry Shearer &apos;s throat and, eventually, the voice became too annoying for Groening, which, he acknowledges, is the point. { Jean, Al (2001).

She first appeared in &quot; Bart Gets Famous &quot;, { Richmond, p. 215 } when she walks in on Mayor Quimby in bed with another woman, an event she laughs off when he defends himself with &quot; I didn&apos;t do it. &quot; She is humiliated when Marge accidentally uncovers her husband&apos;s lothario ways in &quot; The Last of the Red Hat Mamas &quot; and kicks Marge and her friends out before they can have tea.

He is an academically brilliant, teacher&apos;s pet, and is portrayed as a stereotypical nerd, and is a 4th grade student at Springfield Elementary School. Martin is the son of Martin, Sr. and Martha. He is an academically brilliant student, portrayed when he first appears in the second episode of the series. He is also a teacher&apos;s pet with the stereotypical nerd enthusiasms for science fiction, role-playing game s and not-so-great fashion sense. He has an IQ of 216. As the class nerd, he unwittingly becomes the perfect target for ruthless bullying at Springfield Elementary School. He is a member of the Springfield band, and is often seen with a French Horn. Martin&apos;s most famous catchphrases are &quot; Behold! &quot; and &quot; Excelsior! &quot;. [ Martin Prince, Sr. ] Martin Prince, Sr. is the father of Martin Prince, and husband of Martha Prince. He is a stock broker in Springfield and was shown bringing his son to work on &quot; Go To Work With Your Parents Day &quot;, where Martin made over $1 million trading soy futures (and subsequently lost all but $600). He appears to be a nerd much like his son, seeing as he has somewhat of a lisp. Martin Sr. was also one of the fathers that went in Ned Flanders&apos;s RV, to find their sons in Shelbyville. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. [ Mary Bailey ] Mary Bailey is the governor of Springfield&apos;s state. She is voiced by Maggie Roswell. She ran against Mr. Burns in &quot; Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish &quot;, winning in a landslide after Mr. Burns spit out a piece of baked Three eyed Fish during a photo-op at the Simpsons&apos; home.

She decides to release all the abused prisoners to a garbage barge where they would &quot; bare-knuckle box until one of you emerges as king of your floating hell. &quot; She looks nearly identical to Bea Simmons, Abe Simpson&apos;s former girlfriend in the episode Old Money. [ Maude Flanders ] Maude Flanders, voiced by Maggie Roswell and temporarily by Marcia Mitzman Gaven between 1999 and 2000 when Roswell did not work for the show, was the wife of Ned Flanders, and the mother of Rod and Todd. While she was not employed outside the home, Maude was a busy homemaker and a tireless advocate for the children, whose innocence is so often sullied by the &quot; evils &quot; of cartoon violence, liberal education, and the insidious influences of popular culture. Even though she spent much of her free time in prayer and reading the Bible and helping out her husband at the Leftorium, Maude was known to let her hair down for the occasional dinner party at the home of her neighbors, the Simpsons. Homer often made statements insinuating his attraction to Maude, thereby literally coveting his neighbor&apos;s wife. Also, in the second season episode &quot; The War of the Simpsons &quot;, Homer ogled Maude&apos;s cleavage at a dinner party, which resulted in him and Marge going to marriage camp. In the season eleven episode &quot; Alone Again, Natura-Diddily &quot;, Maude was killed by a t-shirt cannon at the Springfield Speedway when Homer ducked at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. [ Seifert Andy Indiana Man says no to the White Sox T-shirt cannons http://www.avclub.com/chicago/articles/indiana-man-says-no-to-the-white-sox-tshirt-cannon%2C26920/ The A.V. Club 2009-04-26 2010-08-08 ] She was knocked off the grandstand and her rescue was prevented as Homer had parked in the ambulance zone, impeding their rescue attempt. Her death crushed Ned who, though used to some measure of hardship, assumed that they would always be together. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show.

In &quot; Mayored to the Mob &quot;, she is one of two women escorting Mayor Quimby to a convention. Since then, she is often seen escorting him to Springfield events such as conventions, recitals, and plays. In one episode, it is revealed she is illiterate.

In &quot; Smoke on the Daughter &quot;, she appears (and claims to be) pregnant, and Quimby believes he may be the father. [ Mr. Costington ] Mr. Costington, voiced by Hank Azaria, is the president of Costington&apos;s Department Store. He first appeared as &quot; Chairman &quot; { Gimple, p. 38 } in the season nine episode &quot; Trash of the Titans &quot;, in which he invented &quot; Love Day &quot;, and later in &quot; Homer vs. Dignity &quot;. He is one of very few characters on the show who has eyebrows. Costington&apos;s catchphrase is &quot; You&apos;re fiiired! &quot;, delivered while shaking his jowls. In &quot; The Boys of Bummer &quot;, he hires Homer with a jowl-shaking &quot; You&apos;re hiiired! &quot; Homer has worked for him on three occasions: as a Thanksgiving Day Parade Santa Claus, mattress salesman, and model for top-brand jeans. He also employs the Yes Guy, who is seen working at the store in most of his appearances.

He first appeared in &quot; Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge &quot;. Like Krusty, he is a heavy smoker, and often seems depressed off-stage. He is sometimes seen as Krusty’s driver and butler. Teeny’s uncle was former head monkey at the ministry of tourism in Brazil. Three other monkeys have died while working for Krusty known by the same name. Krusty once said he missed the third Mr. Teeny and the current one couldn’t hold a candle to him. In the episode &quot; Day of the Jackanapes &quot; Teeny saves Krusty from a bomb that Sideshow Bob has attached to Bart. His mother’s name is Toot-Toot, and she refers to him as Louis when they are reunited in &quot; Bart Has Two Mommies &quot;. Teeny also was a writer for the “Good Guy Awards” and quit after being insulted on-stage by Krusty. He is an immigrant from Brazil and has been deported but was returned.

As of &quot; Wedding For Disaster &quot;, there have been seven Mr. Teenys. [ Mrs. Glick ] Alice { The Simpsons season 23, episode 4: &quot; } { Replaceable You &quot; } Glick is an elderly shut-in for whom Bart did chores in &quot; Three Men and a Comic Book &quot;; he didn&apos;t get paid very well, so he started to hate her. She had a brother named Asa, mentioned in the same episode, who died during World War I; he was killed by his own grenade, which he held for too long. Doctor Hibbert once confessed to leaving his car keys inside her. She is occasionally seen in the background of various episodes, often with a toothless laugh.

She later dies due to a heart attack caused by an invention Bart and Martin create in the episode &quot; Replaceable You &quot;. Her final scene is dancing with Jesus in Heaven. [ Mrs. Muntz ] Mrs. Muntz, voiced by Tress MacNeille. She is Nelson Muntz &apos;s mother. Nelson receives his trademark laugh from her. Early on in the series, Nelson would often mention his parents, and it was often implied that Nelson&apos;s mother does not care for him. In &quot; A Milhouse Divided &quot;, Nelson tells Milhouse that his mom is addicted to cough drop s, which is why his father left the family.Mrs. Muntz works at Hooters in &quot; Bart Star &quot;, but was fired in a later episode for gaining weight. She owns a dilapidated house and is depicted as a jailbird, a prostitute, a stripper, or something similar. In &quot; &apos;Tis the Fifteenth Season &quot;, she appears, telling Nelson that his father simply did not like him, and he left with her golden tooth. Nelson&apos;s mother was fully introduced in &quot; Sleeping with the Enemy &quot;, after years of being mentioned. A loud, high-pitched contemptuous woman, she neglects Nelson. She implies she misses Nelson&apos;s father. At the end of the episode, the three Muntzes reunite, and she receives a new job as Lady Macbeth, with &quot; the third director she slept with &quot;. Since then, she is often seen around in Springfield. Curiously, in Season 18 &apos;s &quot; The Haw-Hawed Couple &quot;, she appears with brown hair. As revealed in &quot; Dial &apos;N&apos; for Nerder &quot;, Nelson even refers to her as Mrs. Muntz. [ Old Barber ] Jake the Barber { McCann, p. 86 } originated in one of the Tracey Ullman shorts, &quot; Bart&apos;s Haircut &quot;. { Silverman, David (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { Homer Defined &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox } In the short, he cuts Bart&apos;s hair not to his liking and Bart tries several ways to hide it. Dan Castellaneta, voiced the Old Barber in that short and in subsequent episodes in the series, based the voice on comedian Bob Elliott &apos;s. { Castellaneta, Dan (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { Homer Defined &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox } The Old Barber made his last appearance in the twelfth season episode &quot; Lisa the Tree Hugger &quot;. He was voiced by Harry Shearer in that episode. { McCann, p. 87 } David Silverman had to create a model sheet of the Old Barber for Jim Reardon, who directed &quot; 22 Short Films about Springfield. &quot; Before then, there was no model sheet for the character. { Reardon, Jim; Silverman, David (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox } [ Old Jewish Man ] Asa, a.k.a. Old Jewish Man, or Crazy Old Man (according to &quot; Krusty Gets Kancelled &quot; ) is Abraham Simpson and Jasper Beardly &apos;s friend. Mayor Quimby once referred to him as &quot; Old Jewish Man &quot;; also, a list of heart recipients in &quot; Homer&apos;s Paternity Coot &quot; listed him as &quot; Old Jewish Man &quot;. He speaks with a stereotypical Jewish-American accent (voiced by Hank Azaria ), and curses in Yiddish in one episode. He is apparently friendly with Krusty the Clown and Krusty&apos;s father, according to &quot; Simpsons Christmas Stories &quot;. He is often seen yelling at people, and as seen in &quot; Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores &quot;, owns a store called Zip Boys, a parody of Pep Boys. He once had a brief period of stardom after his act of dancing on a street corner singing &quot; The Old Gray Mare &quot; with his pants down became a hit on television. In &quot; Natural Born Kissers &quot;, it was revealed that he worked as a studio executive during the making of Casablanca and suppressed an alternate ending to the film. He was also responsible for a &quot; Killing Spree Ending &quot; to It&apos;s a Wonderful Life. He observes that the quality of studio management has changed over the years. In &quot; Love Is a Many Strangled Thing &quot; he dies by dancing too hard, although his ghost continues dancing. He reappears in &quot; Replaceable You &quot; alive. [ Opal ] Opal (voiced by Tress MacNeille ) is a talk show host. This celebrity is based on Oprah, as is her show. She first appears in &quot; Ice Cream of Margie (with the Light Blue Hair) &quot; where her segment on successful women depresses Marge, who feels her life of chores and child-raising has left her without any purpose. She later appeared in the back-to-back nineteenth season episodes &quot; Husbands and Knives &quot; and &quot; Funeral for a Fiend &quot;. Marge is a fan of hers, and was interviewed by Opal after achieving success through her chain of Shapes gyms for women. [ Otto Mann ] Otto Mann voiced by Harry Shearer is the school bus driver for Springfield Elementary School. Otto is notable for his maniacal driving style (which, along with never getting a driver&apos;s license, cost him his job on the season three episode &quot; The Otto Show &quot; ), his love of heavy metal music, drugs and his propensity for sounding and acting like a perpetual 1980s teenager. In early seasons he is often used as a friend and confidant to Bart, despite their age difference. Later seasons, however, usually only depict him as a passerby citizen of Springfield. He is a (last-minute) member of Homer&apos;s bowling team, the &quot; Pin Pals &quot;. { &quot; } { Team Homer &quot; } Otto is a skilled guitarist, having done little else but practice during high school. { &quot; } { The Otto Show &quot; } [ Patches and Poor Violet ] Patches and Poor Violet are two of Springfield&apos;s orphans, voiced by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille, respectively. Introduced in “ Miracle on Evergreen Terrace,” Patches gives the dollar they were saving to Bart, which was their vitamin money. They have since had cameos in “ I&apos;m Goin&apos; to Praiseland ” and “ Simple Simpson,” but are seen in many other episodes. Poor Violet often has a cough, while Patches seems to vaguely resemble Tiny Tim from Charles Dickens ’ A Christmas Carol. Their skin color is not the “healthy” yellow of the Simpson family, but rather a more sallow, sickly tone. [ Plopper ] [ Spider-Pig For the variation of Spider-Man who happens to be a pig, see Spider-Ham. For the song of the same name, see The Simpsons Movie: The Music ] Plopper, also known as Spider-Pig and later renamed to Harry Plopper (a play on the popular fictional character Harry Potter ), is a pig who first appears in The Simpsons Movie. Plopper has since become memetic, gaining immense popularity in the real world and on the internet, especially his theme song &quot; Spider-Pig &quot;, which peaked at number 23 in the UK Singles Chart. [ http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id%3D33298 Hans Zimmer - Spider Pig Chart Stats 2011-10-23 ] The pig is voiced by Tress MacNeille. Plopper has also made appearances in the episodes and comics, and also appears in the reanimated opening sequence, featuring in the pan across Springfield. Plopper&apos;s first appearance is in the movie, where he stars in a TV ad to promote Krusty&apos;s new burger, The Clogger. After the filming is completed, Krusty orders the pig to be killed. Homer becomes upset about this, and immediately adopts him. Homer then spends a lot of time with Plopper and neglects Bart. Later in the movie, Homer is seen making the pig walk on the ceiling whilst singing &quot; Spider Pig &quot;, a parody of the Spider-Man theme song. Homer later calls him Harry Plopper, and the pig is seen with glasses and a lightning bolt-shaped scar, based on the character Harry Potter. At one point in the movie, the Simpsons&apos; house is completely destroyed after being sucked into a sinkhole in their backyard. This may lead to the assumption that the pig is killed in the movie. However, during the 2007 San Diego Comic Convention, an official Simpsons Panel revealed that there was a scene at the end of the movie involving the pig that was cut which later appeared on the DVD. { IGN: SDCC 07: The Simpsons Panel } This removed sequence is a slightly alternate ending of the movie when the townspeople are rebuilding the Simpsons&apos; house and involves Plopper, the Multi-Eyed Creature, and Santa&apos;s Little Helper painting a dog house. During the following TV seasons, Plopper makes a few more appearances. [ Poochie ] When network executives decided that The Itchy and Scratchy Show needed an &quot; update &quot; to keep the interest of its audience, they devised Poochie, a cartoon dog &quot; with an attitude. &quot; After widespread auditions, Homer was chosen to provide Poochie&apos;s voice. The character debuted to an unimpressed audience following a massive publicity campaign; he only served to interfere with the well-oiled machine of hyperviolent slapstick that Itchy and Scratchy had perfected over the years. When dissatisfied viewers flooded the network with letters crying for Poochie&apos;s immediate removal, if not death, the executives quickly decided to get rid of the character. Homer begged for another chance, insisting that Poochie would grow on the audience; this argument held little weight until the actress who performed voices for both Itchy and Scratchy declared her support for Poochie as well. Homer was shocked, however, when the next cartoon aired: it contained a hastily-animated, retroscript ed segment stating that Poochie had decided to return to his &quot; home planet, &quot; and that he died when his spaceship crashed. He has since been seen once in a cameo at a funeral in an Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoon featured in Little Big Mom. Also in &quot; Treehouse of Horror IX, &quot; he skateboards in the road and gets run over by Scratchy driving a car. However he survives only to have his skateboard falling form the sky and hitting him in the head. He also continues to be released in Itchy &amp; Scratchy related merchandise such as on t-shirts in &quot; Fat Man and Little Boy &quot;. A matrix Poochie also appears in Kill Gil Vols. 1 &amp; 2 during the Krusty on ice show and a Poochie balloon appears in the cartoon in &quot; Funeral for a Fiend &quot;. Poochie reappears in The Simpsons Game as a boss on the Grand Theft Scratchy level. [ Princess Kashmir ] Princess Kashmir is the belly dance r who first appears in &quot; Homer&apos;s Night Out &quot; (and was the first woman who almost ruined Homer&apos;s marriage to Marge as Marge saw Homer dancing with her as a bad example for Bart in how to treat women). She dated Apu in &quot; Lisa&apos;s Pony, &quot; dated Apu&apos;s brother Sanjay on a few occasions, and is seen dancing with Chief Wiggum in the episode &quot; Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment &quot; (which also shocked and offended the women in town, much like what happened with Homer). She has also appeared in two couch gag s (the one on &quot; Marge vs. The Monorail, in which the Simpsons sit on the couch, followed by three rows of recurring extras and secondary characters, and the Sgt. Pepper album parody on &quot; Bart After Dark &quot; and the original airing of &quot; The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochy Show &quot; ), and is seen dancing on the stage in the Maison Derrière in the episode &quot; Bart After Dark &quot;. Her nickname is &apos;Queen of the Mysterious East&apos;. Her real name is Shauna Tifton, and also goes by April Flowers when performing in strip clubs. According to the DVD commentary for the season eight episode &quot; Bart After Dark, &quot; Princess Kashmir was originally going to be an actual bachelor party stripper on her premiere episode, but the FOX censors at the time objected (though they had no problem letting Princess Kashmir tell Bart that she works under the name &quot; April Flowers &quot; when she performs at strip clubs). [ Principal Dondelinger ] Harlan Dondelinger, voiced by Harry Shearer was Springfield High School&apos;s principal, first seen in the episode &quot; The Way We Was &quot;, a flashback to Homer and Marge &apos;s senior year in high school. He later appeared in the episode &quot; The Front &quot; at Homer and Marge&apos;s high school reunion and teaches night classes to ease the pain of his wife&apos;s recent death. He appeared in &quot; Half-Decent Proposal &quot; when Artie Ziff, Marge&apos;s high school prom date, recreated their prom. Dondelinger made his most recent appearance in the twentieth season episode &quot; Take My Life, Please &quot;. [ Rabbi Hyman Krustofski ] Hyman Krustofski is the father of Krusty the Clown. He first appeared in the third season episode &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot;. { Richmond, p. 103 } In this episode, in season fifteen &apos;s &quot; Today I Am a Clown &quot;, and season twenty-one &apos;s &quot; Once Upon a Time in Springfield &quot; he is voiced by comedian Jackie Mason (because in the three episodes, he was a major character, while in cameo speaking appearances, he is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. However, recent cameo speaking episodes have him again voiced by Jackie Mason). In &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot;, Rabbi Krustofski had been estranged from his son for twenty-five years. He disowned Krusty when the young man chose to become a clown when Krustofski had wanted him to follow the family tradition of becoming a rabbi. Years later, after much exchanging of Talmud passages between Bart Simpson and Rabbi Krustofski, Bart read the Rabbi a quote from Sammy Davis, Jr. admiring the Jews, which finally convinced Rabbi Krustofski to accept his son for his career in entertainment. He and Krusty reunited on the air of Krusty&apos;s show. The episode is a parody of the film The Jazz Singer. The parody was writer Jay Kogen &apos;s idea. [ Wolodarsky, Wallace The Simpsons The Complete Third Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] He thought it would be a funny parallel—and a chance to do a lot of easy jokes—if it were a clown instead of a singer who gets rejected by his father. [ Kogen, Jay The Simpsons The Complete Third Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] The character&apos;s casting was fitting in that the real-life Mason, like Krusty, also came from a family of rabbis but rejected his destiny in order to become a comedian. Jackie Mason won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance as Krustofsky in &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot; in 1992.

The song was featured on The Simpsons: Testify. She returns in &quot; I&apos;m Goin&apos; to Praiseland &quot;. She stays at the Flanders&apos; house with Ned, and leaves briefly after Ned attempted to mold her in the image of his deceased wife Maude only to have her think Ned is using her and runs off. At the end of the episode, she returns and has a date with Flanders. She has not made an appearance since. [ Radioactive Man ] Radioactive Man is a fictional comic book superhero. The character was heavily featured in the episodes &quot; Three Men and a Comic Book &quot; and &quot; Radioactive Man &quot;. Within the Simpsons universe, he was created by Morty Mann.

In one episode of The Simpsons, a Hollywood studio attempted to film a Radioactive Man movie in Springfield. The movie starred Rainier Wolfcastle as Radioactive Man. The role of Fallout Boy, Radioactive Man&apos;s sidekick, was cast from local children and went to Milhouse Van Houten. The movie was never completed due to budget overruns caused by constant price-gouging by Springfield vendors, and Milhouse snapping from the pressure of the role, and refusing to continue to portray Fallout Boy. { Season seven episode &quot; } { Radioactive Man &quot;. } Outside of The Simpsons, the Radioactive Man character also appeared in a real comic book series based on him that was first published by Bongo Comics in 1993. [ http://simpsons.ugo.com/?cur%3Dradioactive-man-comic%26amp%3Bgallery%3Dtrue Radioactive Man 2008-08-03 UGO Networks ] The Bongo comics expanded more on the character, including his powers, giving him several which parodied those of Superman including super speed, flight, and the power to fire beams of &quot; clean, nuclear heat &quot; from his eyes. The character has also appeared in issues of Simpsons Comics and Simpsons Super Spectacular, and in the 1992 video game Bartman Meets Radioactive Man.

Commentary for &quot; } { A Star Is Burns &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } This basis has been drawn out over the series. Wolfcastle&apos;s wife is named Maria, just like the real Schwarzenegger&apos;s now separated wife Maria Shriver. Like Schwarzenegger, Wolfcastle is an active member of the Republican Party and owns a Hummer. In the episode &quot; The Boy Who Knew Too Much &quot;, Bart Simpson tells Wolfcastle that his &quot; last movie really sucked &quot; (Along with Chief Wiggum &apos;s line of &quot; &apos;Magic Ticket&apos; my ass, McBain! &quot; ), alluding to Schwarzenegger&apos;s film Last Action Hero, which was panned by critics. { Mirkin, David (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { The Boy Who Knew Too Much &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. Twentieth Century Fox. } Wolfcastle owns a restaurant named Planet Springfield, a parody of Planet Hollywood, which Schwarzenegger co-owned with other celebrities. [ Weinstein, Josh 2006 Commentary for &quot; My Sister, My Sitter &quot;. The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season DVD 20th Century Fox ] Wolfcastle has starred in many action movies, most notably the McBain series (a parody of action movies) and the movie of Radioactive Man. Rainier’s more recent movies have gained less renown, and he is even forced to do comedies and even standup comedy. Wolfcastle has made cameo appearances as an Academy Award presenter, a celebrity spokesperson, and a celebrity judge. In a recall election of Mayor Quimby, Wolfcastle ran for his seat. He has a daughter named Greta who had a crush on Bart in the episode &quot; The Bart Wants What It Wants &quot;. The writers invented Wolfcastle as the action hero McBain for the episode &quot; Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? &quot;. Because they liked the scene involving the character from that episode, they used him again in &quot; The Way We Was &quot;, which was recorded and aired before &quot; Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? &quot; The McBain films satirize clichés of action films. { Groening, Matt; Martin, Jeff; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The character was originally named McBain, until an actual film called McBain was released in 1991. That film&apos;s producers refused to allow the show to use the name, so &quot; Rainier Wolfcastle &quot; became the name of the actor playing the McBain role. { Groening, Matt; Brooks, James L.; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Silverman, David (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { The Way We Was &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson, doubles as Wolfcastle when Harry Shearer is absent from table reads. [ Rich Texan ] Colonel Antoine &quot; Tex &quot; O&apos;Hara, often referred to simply as the Rich Texan, voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is a stereotypical rich, callous but gregarious business owner. He is an active member of the Springfield Republican Party and speaks with a heavy Texas drawl. His morality can wildly vary from episode to episode; he can sometimes be selfish and sadistic, and at other times polite and friendly. He is based on the Texan oil tycoon character from Alfred Hitchcock &apos;s Psycho. [ August 2011 ] In the fifth season episode &quot; $pringfield &quot; (the Rich Texan&apos;s debut, though a similar character once appeared in the season two episode &quot; Old Money &quot; ), Homer addresses the Rich Texan as Senator, although this was never again referenced. Rich Texan sports a bolo tie and a white cowboy hat. He is also obsessive-compulsive, as revealed in &quot; The Seemingly Never-Ending Story &quot;. He has stated in &quot; Marge&apos;s Son Poisoning &quot; that he enjoys moonlit walks on the beach; in the same episode he held Homer and Moe at gunpoint while forcing them to walk along with him after being tricked by the two. He is well known for pulling out a pair of revolvers and firing them into the air while yelling &quot; Yee Haw! &quot; whenever he is happy or excited. He has a gay grandson, as revealed in &quot; Million Dollar Abie &quot; and a daughter named Paris Texan (who looks and acts like hotel heiress Paris Hilton ). In the episode &quot; Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Three Times &quot;, it is revealed that the Rich Texan is originally from Connecticut, despite his brash, stereotypically Southern persona. This is a reference to George W. Bush &apos;s Connecticut roots. [ Richard ] Richard is a gray-haired student at Springfield Elementary School and is one of Bart&apos;s good friends. He is first seen in &quot; Bart the Genius &quot;. He is usually seen with Lewis and has a leather jacket and a shirt with a small diamond embroidered on the center. Richard appears frequently in scenes involving the Springfield children, and in the early seasons was often involved with mischief. he&apos;s been voiced over the course of the series by Nancy Cartwright, Jo Ann Harris, Pamela Hayden, and Maggie Roswell. In early seasons he was commonly seen hanging out with Bart, Lewis, and Milhouse, but in recent years he is only seen in the classroom and in crowd scenes. He had a brief speaking part in &quot; The Haw-Hawed Couple &quot;, in which he was voiced by Pamela Hayden. His hair color changes from black to gray, to brown, and then to blue throughout the course of the show. However, in Simpsons Comics, his hair always appears gray. [ Rod Flanders ] Rod Flanders is voiced by Pamela Hayden. Rod is Ned Flanders&apos; 10 year old son. Rod prays often; first thing in the morning and last thing before bed. He prays for God to watch over him and his younger brother, Todd, as well as for the success of his father&apos;s business. He also prays for all of the other children like his neighbor Bart Simpson, who do not pray for themselves. Ned has described Rod&apos;s hobbies as including &quot; being quiet during trips, clapping with songs and diabetes &quot;. Rod&apos;s largest role was in &quot; Bart Has Two Mommies &quot;, where he obtains new climbing skills and rescues Bart from a chimpanzee atop a church. This episode also reveals that Rod thinks of Marge as the most fun he has had since his mother died. In &quot; &apos;Tis the Fifteenth Season, &quot; he mentions that he is &quot; jealous of girls &apos;cause they get to wear dresses, &quot; suggesting nascent transvestism. In a &quot; freeze-frame gag &quot; in the episode &quot; Homer Badman &quot;, Rod is stated to be the younger Flanders child. [ Ruth Powers ] Ruth Powers is the Simpsons &apos; next-door neighbor, introduced when she moves to their neighborhood in the episode &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot;. She is divorced and has a daughter, Laura Powers. According to &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot;, Ruth divorced her husband because his career got in the way with his family life, but in &quot; Marge on the Lam &quot;, Ruth tells Marge that all her husband ever did was &quot; eat, sleep, and drink beer &quot; and never gave her money for child support (which led to Ruth stealing her husband&apos;s convertible). She is usually seen as a background character, sometimes in events that occurred even before she moved next door (such as the baby shower for Maggie in &quot; And Maggie Makes Three &quot; ). She even continues to be a background character despite her later imprisonment. She nearly always wears a red headscarf. In the episode &quot; The Cartridge Family &quot; she was part of the NRA. She was voiced by Pamela Reed in her first two speaking appearances. David Mirkin said that Pamela Reed would always give great performances and that he does not know why they did not use her more. { Mirkin, David (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Marge on the Lam &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The episode &quot; Marge on the Lam &quot; features Ruth and Marge going on the run from the law in a stolen convertible, a parody of Thelma &amp; Louise. Ruth makes an appearance in the episode &quot; Strong Arms of the Ma &quot;, as a huge female bodybuilder, advising Marge (who is taking up weightlifting) to use steroid s. She reveals during her time in prison, she was &quot; Miss Mexican Mafia &quot;. In the episode &quot; The Bob Next Door &quot; Ruth moves away from Evergreen Terrace. [ Sam and Larry ] Sam and Larry, also known as &quot; Barfly #1 &quot; and &quot; Barfly #2 &quot;, are two regular patrons of Moe&apos;s Tavern. Their first appearance is in &quot; Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire &quot;. Virtually nothing is known about them, except that Sam always wears a cap and glasses and Larry has an orange jacket and a balding head and either looks extremely drunk or very depressed. Sam has spoken only a few times throughout the series; on the season three episode &quot; Lisa the Greek &quot;, Sam asks Homer who he bet on during the Super Bowl. In &quot; Worst Episode Ever &quot; Sam is shot in the back by Moe, for trying to pay in Sacagawea dollar s. Larry hasn&apos;t spoken, except for in fantasy sequences (in &quot; Marge Be Not Proud, &quot; Larry utters a garbled, &quot; Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year &quot; after Bart receives a soiled wig during Bart&apos;s image of spending Christmas in juvenile hall and in &quot; Simpson Tide, &quot; Larry grumbles, &quot; This stupid machine took my money! &quot; when Apu was thinking of his loved one -- in this case, his Kwik-E-Mart ciagrette machine that steals money and doesn&apos;t dispense cigarettes). [ Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon ] Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon ( Hindi ), voiced by Harry Shearer, is Apu Nahasapeemapetilon &apos;s younger half-brother and uncle of Apu&apos;s eight children. He has a daughter named Pahusacheta and a son named Jamshed. Sanjay has a wife, as he asked Apu to promise not to sleep with her if he dies (Apu&apos;s response to this request was a cheery &quot; I promise nothing! &quot; ). Sanjay was shown as Apu&apos;s business partner at the Kwik-E-Mart in the earlier episodes. His final speaking appearance was in I&apos;m with Cupid. However, he has appeared as a background character in Moe Letter Blues, Homer at the Bat (as pitcher for Fort Springfield), and The Simpsons Movie. [ Sarah Wiggum ] Sarah Wiggum (née Kanickee), voiced by Pamela Hayden. She is the gentle wife of Chief Wiggum and mother of Ralph Wiggum. She first appeared in the fourth season episode &quot; Duffless &quot;. { Groening, Matt (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Duffless &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Like Bernice Hibbert and Martha Quimby, she is one of the less notable characters who hardly ever speaks; however in The Simpsons Game she only ever says &quot; Clancy! &quot;, whether hit or in Marge&apos;s mob. In the episode, &quot; A Star Is Born-Again &quot;, at the Jellyfish Dance, Clancy mentions she was more beautiful at that moment than the day he arrested her, to which she giggles in reply. He then mentions he only planted the crystal meth on her so she would &quot; notice &quot; him. Sarah (according to Clancy) is his &quot; home force &quot; and he affectionately calls her &quot; Poppin&apos; Fresh &quot;. In the episode, &quot; Grade School Confidential &quot;, she immediately dials the authorities to Clancy&apos;s command. Ralph apparently gets his appearance from her, as the two look very similar. [ Scott Christian ] Scott Christian (voiced by Dan Castellaneta ) is a newsreader from the early seasons of the show. Originally, Christian and Kent Brockman shared the anchor desk equally, but eventually Brockman started to become the more commonly used anchor. In his final appearances, Christian was used mostly when Kent was in the field and an introduction was needed. His final speaking appearance was &quot; The Boy Who Knew Too Much &quot;. Christian was supposed to be permanent anchor, { Season 1 DVD Commentary - &quot; } { Krusty Gets Busted &quot; } always filling in for an absent Brockman, but was quickly phased out as the show progressed. He briefly appeared (with red colored hair) with the other Springfield celebrities in the season 18 episode &quot; Homerazzi &quot; and made a cameo in &quot; Guess Who&apos;s Coming to Criticize Dinner? &quot;. [ Sea Captain ] Captain McCallister (Horatio or Pete), more commonly known as &quot; The Sea Captain &quot;, voiced by Hank Azaria. Azaria modelled the voice on actor Robert Newton, who played pirates in several movies. { Azaria, Hank (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { New Kid on the Block &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The writers&apos; &quot; love of sea talk &quot; is what inspired them to invent the Sea Captain. { Martin, Jeff (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { I Married Marge &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } His character is based on the stereotype of sailors and pirates, including the stereotypical pirate catchphrase, &quot; Yarr! &quot; He is a member of the Springfield Alcoholics Anonymous and has a peg leg in which he keeps liquor. In &quot; The Bart of War &quot; he uses his wooden leg to have a vicious sword fight with Sideshow Mel &apos;s bone. The Sea Captain is always seen holding a corncob pipe and squinting: because he has at least one glass eye - though once he was seen tapping both of his eyes and says he has &apos;two glass eyes.&apos; In addition to eye(s), he also has an artificial leg. As an entrepreneur, McCallister is equally incompetent. On several occasions, he acknowledges his incompetence with a depressed: &quot; Yarr, I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doin&apos;. &quot; Although he once states under oath (in &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot; ) that he is not a real sea captain, at various occasions in later episodes he is indeed shown captaining a ship. His restaurant, The Frying Dutchman, is a failing business venture that does not generate enough income to support its owner. During the episode &quot; Mr. Plow &quot;, the Captain pitches his 90 track sea shanties CD set in a commercial, which aired on Public-access television cable TV channel 92. In the episode &quot; Lisa Gets an &quot; A &quot; &quot;, the captain appears as a penniless bum. When seeing Homer and Marge walking Homer&apos;s pet lobster at the beach, he approaches them and claims that he runs a &quot; small academy for lobsters &quot;. However, when Marge refuses to send the lobster away to &quot; some snobby boarding school &quot;, McCallister asks her for spare change instead. His only main roles were in episodes &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot; and in &quot; The Wettest Stories Ever Told &quot;. In the former, Homer sues his restaurant The Frying Dutchman because they kicked him out at the restaurant&apos;s closing time before Homer had eaten all he could eat. In the latter, he cannot bring the Simpsons their food for numerous reasons like the &quot; chef having problems with tonight&apos;s special &quot;, which was an octopus. He then ignores the family while playing pickup basketball games with the restaurant&apos;s staff. [ Sherri and Terri ] Sherri and Terri, voiced by Russi Taylor, are identical twins with long purple hair and pale skin. They perpetually reinforce their identities as twins, with things such as making up their own &apos;twin&apos; language. They are in the same class as Bart at Springfield Elementary School. In &quot; Homer&apos;s Odyssey &quot; it is revealed that their father is Homer &apos;s supervisor at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He fires Homer for causing an accident while waving to Bart from a cart during a school tour of the plant. Homer, however, had the last laugh when he was promoted above the twins&apos; father to safety inspector. Their mother is shown in &quot; Bart Sells His Soul &quot; and looks just like her daughters. Sherri is two seconds older than Terri; { The Simpsons Game } they share their birthday with Rod Flanders. The girls themselves dress identically, reinforcing their &quot; twin-ness &quot;. They are quite snobbish, and never miss an opportunity to berate Bart. Bart appears to have a crush on one of them, as admitted in &quot; Hungry, Hungry Homer &quot;. Sherri referred to Bart as an ugly, smelly dork, but was persuaded by Homer to go on a date with Bart after he told her that she could not do much better. One of the twins stated that her sister had a crush on Bart in &quot; Bart Star &quot;. Another time, in &quot; Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder &quot;, Homer openly addressed Terri as &quot; the girl Bart has a crush on &quot;. In The Way We Weren&apos;t, they introduce a cousin who has a crush on Bart. In The Blue and the Gray it was revealed that they were actually conjoined triplets, and that the third triplet is seeking revenge. The third triplet is seen in The Daughter Also Rises, but they state it is probably an optical illusion. In &quot; Lisa&apos;s Substitute &quot;, they nominate Bart as the class president. [ Sideshow Mel ] Melvin Van Horne, better known as Sideshow Mel (voiced by Dan Castellaneta ), is Krusty the Clown &apos;s sidekick. He replaced Sideshow Bob after Bob was incarcerated for framing Krusty for armed robbery. Mel&apos;s hiring was never explicitly shown in the series and his full name was only revealed when he announced himself while trying to solve the mystery of who shot Mr. Burns in the episode &quot; Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two) &quot; and in the episode &quot; All About Lisa &quot; on the portrait of Sideshow Mel in the past. He first appeared in &quot; Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge &quot;, shortly after Sideshow Bob was sent to prison, filling the exact role that Bob once did. Little is known about Mel. He is a Cornell University graduate, and a former Gulp &apos;n Blow employee (during the time that Krusty&apos;s show was cancelled and Bart and Lisa set out to create a comeback special). Sideshow Mel is revealed, in the episode entitled &quot; All About Lisa &quot;, to have been the winner of the prestigious Springfield Entertainer of the Year award. The intoxication of applause made him reduce himself to ridiculous behavior for laughter, which he compared to doing heroin and checking email. Sideshow Mel uses a slide whistle to communicate on camera just like Bob. When not in character, Mel speaks in a grandiose English / Shakespeare an accent (Castellaneta&apos;s play on Kelsey Grammer &apos;s character, Sideshow Bob ) and owns poodles. When Springfield inhabitants form an angry mob, Mel often takes a leading role. Mel wears a bone in his hair that has been used as a weapon. In &quot; Homerazzi &quot; it was revealed that Mel was in a bitter custody battle and that he has a son, who looks just like him except without a bone in his hair. In &quot; I&apos;m with Cupid &quot;, he reveals he has a wife named Barbara, who appears in &quot; Realty Bites &quot; where they are bowling in a house that Marge tries to sell to them. She is revealed to be giving birth in the episode &quot; All About Lisa &quot;, suggesting that Mel has at least two children. She looks like a European woman, and has light hair. It has been suggested that Mel is very wealthy, able to afford betting thousands of dollars on football regularly. Sideshow Mel is often subject to abuse by Krusty, just as Sideshow Bob was before him. Such occurrences include &apos;Krusty&apos;s Slide&apos;, where he is forced into a mixture of pudding, pickle brine and laundry detergent, a tub of rancid Béarnaise sauce and a tub of refried beans; another unseen one is in &quot; Krusty Gets Kancelled &quot; where he states that Krusty once poured liquid nitrogen down his pants and cracked his buttocks with a hammer. In the episode &quot; Day of the Jackanapes &quot;, it is shown that Krusty can remember Sideshow Bob&apos;s name, but not Sideshow Mel&apos;s. [ Snake Jailbird ] Chester &quot; Snake &quot; Turley [ The Fool Monty The Fool Monty The Simpsons The Simpsons Price, Michael (writer); Moore, Steven Dean (director) Fox November 21, 2010 06 22 14:43 ], also known as Snake Jailbird, is voiced by Hank Azaria. { Richmond, p. 178 } A prominent antagonist in the series, he is Springfield &apos;s resident recidivist felon, consistently getting arrested for violent crimes but rarely appearing to stay in jail. He speaks with a &quot; Valley Boy &quot; accent. He is partial to fast cars and fast women, and has a knack for reckless abandon. He owned a car called Li&apos;l Bandit, which Homer won at a police auction (as seen in &quot; Realty Bites &quot; ). Snake first appeared in the season two episode &quot; The War of the Simpsons &quot; as one of the partygoers during Bart and Lisa&apos;s wild house party. Whenever Snake appears in prison, his prison number is always 7F20, the production code of &quot; The War of the Simpsons &quot;. Hank Azaria&apos;s voice for Snake was based on a roommate he had while in college. ) His name was first mentioned by Sideshow Bob in &quot; Black Widower &quot; when Sideshow Bob was saying goodbye to his prison friends after being granted parole. The character was originally named Jailbird. The animators assigned him to the role of Snake in season three &apos;s &quot; Black Widower &quot; and the character has gone by that name ever since. { Groening, Matt (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { Black Widower &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } In the episode &quot; The Seemingly Never-Ending Story &quot;, Lisa tells a story in which Snake refers to himself as Professor Jailbird, an Indiana Jones -like archeologist who turned to robbing convenience store s as revenge for the theft of valuable coins he had excavated. Snake attended Middlebury College, as he robs Moe&apos;s Tavern to pay off his student loans and is shown wearing a Middlebury shirt in &quot; 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot;. He also played lacrosse at Ball State University, according to &quot; Treehouse of Horror IX &quot;, [ http://www.snpp.com/episodes/3F18.html [3F18 &amp; #93; 22 Short Films About Springfield Snpp.com 2008-09-10 ], although it should be noted that the &quot; Treehouse &quot; episodes are considered non- canon. He has a casually hostile relationship with Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, whose convenience store he robs so frequently that Apu considers the continual robberies perfectly normal. Snake is often used as a cutaway foil for Apu; often, when Apu mentions his absence from the Kwik-E-Mart, Snake is shown robbing it, with various snide remarks. In the episode &quot; Marge in Chains &quot;, he literally &quot; shoplifts &quot;, stealing the entire Kwik-E-Mart shop via a flat-bed truck, declaring &quot; I&apos;m taking this baby to Mexico! &quot;. In &quot; Yokel Chords &quot;, he and Apu are seen in a psychiatrist&apos;s office, bickering about Snake&apos;s robberies and shootings in the manner of an unhappily married couple. Snake has a son named Jeremy, who looks just like him (who was introduced in &quot; Pygmoelian &quot; ) and likes to steal bicycles, a trait that Snake encourages. Unlike his father, Jeremy is rather timid as seen in The Seemingly Never-Ending Story. Snake has another child on the way; however, it has been implied he and the mother, Gloria, are no longer in a romantic relationship in the episode &quot; Homer and Lisa Exchange Crosswords &quot;. In the episode &quot; Wedding For Disaster &quot; Snake and Gloria are seen getting married at city hall. In the episode, &quot; Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes &quot;, he is seen with the pregnant Gloria driving a car. [ Squeaky-Voiced Teen ] Squeaky Voiced Teen, aka Pimple-Faced Teen, real name Jeremy Freedman (voiced by Dan Castellaneta ), { Gimple, p. 87 } is one of few teenagers on the show and is perpetually trapped in a series of dead-end jobs, usually working at Krusty Burger (as a cashier or, in the case of &quot; Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy &quot;, a supervisor in charge of training new employees), the grocery store (as a bagboy, as seen in &quot; Selma&apos;s Choice &quot; and &quot; Simpson Safari &quot; ), or at a movie theater (as either the ticket master, concession stand clerk, or usher ). The Squeaky Voiced Teen has acne, and his voice is in the process of breaking. The Squeaky Voiced Teen&apos;s personality is shy, pathetic, miserable, and awkward. He is often concerned about others and usually reports them to his boss; however, when he very rarely is the boss himself, he seizes opportunity and becomes stubborn and evil. Beginning with &quot; Team Homer &quot;, it is revealed that the Squeaky-Voiced Teen&apos;s mother is Lunchlady Doris (who disowns him after he mentions that he can&apos;t give a bowling lane to his own mother on League Night). Castellaneta lifted his voice for the character from actor Richard Crenna &apos;s as Walter Denton in the sitcom Our Miss Brooks. { Castellaneta, Dan (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Boy-Scoutz N the Hood &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Several different models of Squeaky-Voiced Teen have been used throughout the series, featuring counterparts in Mexico, Australia, and England. Steven Dean Moore uses them all as waiters at the ice cream parlor the Simpsons eat at in &quot; It&apos;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge &quot;. { Moore, Steven Dean (2008). Commentary for &quot; } { It&apos;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Matt Groening called Squeaky-Voiced Teen his second favorite &quot; unnamed &quot; character after Comic Book Guy, whose name was finally revealed to be &quot; Jeff Albertson &quot; in the episode &quot; Homer and Ned&apos;s Hail Mary Pass &quot;. { Groening, Matt (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Boy-Scoutz n the Hood &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Stampy ] Stampy is a male African elephant first appearing in the episode &quot; Bart Gets an Elephant &quot; (voiced by Frank Welker ). Bart wins the elephant in a radio contest called &quot; KBBL Is Gonna Gimme Something Stupid &quot;. As a prize, Bart was offered either an elephant or $10,000 in cash, with the elephant option as a joke. Bill and Marty had anticipated all winners would opt for the cash and were caught off guard when Bart chose the elephant. With the prospect of being fired looming, they eventually get Bart an elephant. Bart decides to name the elephant Stampy, who soon starts to cause trouble and costs a large amount of money in upkeep. Anxious to escape this, Homer offers Stampy to a wildlife reserve. However, on his realization that he will get nothing in return, he elects to sell Stampy to local poacher and ivory dealer, Mr. Blackheart. Homer later changes his mind after Stampy rescues him from a tar pit. Stampy likes peanut s and putting people in his mouth. He does not like other elephants, as can be seen when he is first introduced to the wildlife reserve. Stampy is alluded to in other episodes. At Apu&apos;s wedding, Bart sees Apu riding an elephant. Bart comments that he wishes that he had an elephant. Lisa responds, &quot; You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him. &quot; Bart simply replies, &quot; Oh, yeah. &quot; Stampy also appears in &quot; Miracle on Evergreen Terrace &quot; in Bart&apos;s water dream, and made a second (and more important) appearance on season 14&apos;s &quot; Large Marge &quot;, where he was involved in an attempt to restore the public opinion of Krusty the Clown. Stampy also attacks a bear in the final scene of &quot; The Fat and the Furriest &quot;, but then the bear fights back by hitting Stampy on the head with a club several times, much to Stampy&apos;s dismay. Stampy also appears in The Simpsons Movie, where he cracks the dome that covers Springfield, prompting the government&apos;s drastic action. [ State Comptroller Atkins ] State Comptroller Atkins, voiced by Hank Azaria, is the comptroller of Springfield&apos;s state. In &quot; Lisa Gets an &quot; A &quot; &quot; he is sent to deliver the basic assistance grant to Springfield Elementary after Lisa cheats on a test and raises the school&apos;s GPA up to the state&apos;s minimum requirement. Otto&apos;s impersonation of Atkins suggests that he is of Canadian origin. He appears later in &quot; Saddlesore Galactica &quot;, where he moderates the elementary school band competition at the state fair. He plans to give Lisa the unusually large good sportsmanship award until he hears her brand the first-place band &quot; cheaters &quot; for using glow-sticks in their performance. Atkins&apos; most recent appearance was in &quot; We&apos;re on the Road to D&apos;ohwhere &quot;, in which Superintendent Chalmers and Atkins are participating in a video conference with Skinner. He is also on Lisa&apos;s list of &quot; interesting adults &quot; in &quot; Moe&apos;N&apos;a Lisa &quot;. [ Superintendent Chalmers ] Superintendent Gary Chalmers, voiced by Hank Azaria, is the superintendent of Springfield&apos;s school district. He first appears in the episode &quot; Whacking Day &quot;. Chalmers is a strict and largely humorless man, with a short temper and low tolerance for disorder or rule-breaking; his general manner and personality are like those of a military officer. Whenever he visits Springfield Elementary, some sort of disaster strikes. He produces extreme anxiety in Principal Skinner, who offers increasingly improbable stories to explain what is happening. He is also known for seeming to be in complete disbelief of these improbable stories, but ultimately winds up actually believing them, teasing Skinner and the audience that he may actually take some action. Chalmers is known for throwing open the doors to the room and bellowing &quot; SKIN-NER!!! &quot; or &quot; SEY-MOUR!!! &quot;, to which Seymour stammers &quot; S-Superintendent Chalmers! &quot;. His catchphrase has caused some paranoia in Skinner (as seen in &quot; Lisa&apos;s Date with Density &quot; ). On a few occasions, he says Skinner&apos;s name this way when absolutely nothing has gone wrong, implying that he either pronounces Skinner&apos;s name this way by habit, or does it on purpose to scare him. In Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words, he even pronounces the words &quot; skimmer &quot; and &quot; dinner &quot; in a similar manner to Skinner&apos;s name, who mistakes it as Chalmers wanting his attention. However, Chalmers does on at least two occasions show a fondness for Skinner. In &quot; The Debarted &quot;, both Skinner and Chalmers are lost in the foam of a massive explosion resulting from the mixture of Mentos and Diet Coke, he screams Skinner&apos;s name and upon not receiving an answer, says it again in a softer manner. Skinner then replies to which Chalmers tells him in a frightened voice, &quot; Don&apos;t ever scare me like that again. &quot; More notable, in How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?, when Edna uses a pigeon to taunt Skinner about how much better her life is without him, Chalmers shows compassion for Skinner and even offers his friendship, but unfortunately, Edna reveals that she had an affair with Chalmers, leaving Skinner angry and forcing Chalmers to flee. In &quot; Lisa Simpson, This Isn&apos;t Your Life &quot;, it is revealed that Chalmers has nothing personal against Skinner and that he is aware that the antics within the school are a result of the students&apos; reckless nature and the teachers&apos; indifference, but he can only scold Skinner because he would have to face the ire of the parents or of the Teachers&apos; union if he tries to chastise any group. Chalmers&apos; own competence and dedication to his job are questionable. He lets Ned Flanders allow the school to descend into anarchy when he (Flanders) is principal, freely admitting that he had fired Skinner for far less, explaining simply that &quot; Skinner really bugged me. &quot; He seems disturbingly unconcerned with the school&apos;s decline, saying that &quot; the way America&apos;s public schools are sliding, they&apos;ll all be like this in a matter of months. I say enjoy it — it&apos;s a hell of a toboggan ride! &quot; He also promotes people based on personal bias as opposed to actual competence, promoting Principal Holloway, described by Skinner as a &quot; drunk &quot; and by Chalmers as a &quot; pill-popper &quot;, to assistant superintendent, overlooking the efforts made by Skinner to improve his school&apos;s standing. In the episode &quot; 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot;, he mentions he is from Utica, New York. He has also mentioned that he attended Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. In several episodes, such as &quot; Bart the Fink &quot;, Chalmers is seen dating Agnes Skinner (much to Seymour&apos;s chagrin), although in other episodes, he mentions he is married. His first name is revealed to be Gary in &quot; Yokel Chords &quot; and in &quot; Wild Barts Can&apos;t Be Broken &quot;, and it is revealed that he is a Spanish immigrant Señor Chalmers. In the DVD commentaries to &quot; 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot; and &quot; Grade School Confidential &quot;, it is noted that Superintendent Chalmers seems to be one of the few &quot; normal &quot; characters on the show and is frequently alone in his awareness of the show&apos;s zaniness. In &quot; Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts &quot;, Chalmers indicates that he had a wife that has since died. In the episode &quot; Replaceable You &quot; it is suggested, by Dolph&apos;s science fair project, the toupee detector, that Chalmers wears a wig. The first episode in which he was a main character was Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts, in which he takes over the Elementary School&apos;s Boys. He is fired for allowing Nelson to fall of a cliff, but is reinstated to Super-Duper Intendent after Bart takes over the school. [ Tina Ballerina ] Tina is a cast member on the Krusty the Klown Show and is a heavyset ballerina, most probably used for comedy purposes. Her first appearance was in the episode &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot;. [ Todd Flanders ] Todd Flanders is Ned Flanders&apos; eight year old son, voiced by Nancy Cartwright. His voice is based on Sherman&apos;s from Peabody and Sherman. Todd is the most impressionable member of the Flanders family. When exposed to profanity, he himself starts to curse ( &quot; Hell, no &quot; and &quot; I said I don&apos;t want any damn vegetables &quot; ). When Moe Szyslak loses his temper at Uncle Moe&apos;s Family Feedbag restaurant, Todd responds with &quot; Ow, my freaking ears! &quot; Whether due to immaturity or relentless sheltering by his parents, whenever Todd comes into contact with anything outside his family and their pious ways, such as the time he was tricked into eating a Pixy Stix by Bart Simpson, he turns aggressive, telling his brother to &quot; go to hell zitface &quot;, much to the delight of Bart. Todd can play the violin quite well, and is a part of the Springfield Elementary School band. He also plays mini golf quite well. [ Üter Zörker ] Üter Zörker, [ Üter ] voiced by Russi Taylor, is an overweight German foreign exchange student with a sweet tooth, and odd habits such as offering his already-licked lollipops to others as a sign of friendship, and eating marzipan candies (called Joy Joy) fortified with iodine. He was left behind on the Civil War field trip, according to the season six episode &quot; The PTA Disbands &quot;. His subsequent disappearance from the show for a significant period of time has become a running joke. In &quot; Guess Who&apos;s Coming to Criticize Dinner? &quot; his parents asked Skinner where their missing son was, and in &quot; 24 Minutes &quot; he is seen stuck in a cobweb in the school air vents. It is revealed in the episode &quot; Jazzy and the Pussycats &quot; that he can play the trumpet quite well. He even makes a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory diorama, but eats it before it can be graded in &quot; Lisa&apos;s Rival &quot;. During the school science fair in the season 23 episode &quot; Replaceable You &quot; Kearney has a human skull on display questioning &quot; Is This Üter? &quot; In the German dub of the show, Üter is an exchange student from Switzerland. [ Vanderbilts ] A rich couple who are frequently shocked by Homer&apos;s antics. They first appear in Saddlesore Galactica where Mr Vanderbilt breaks his monocle after being shocked. This gag is reused in A Tale of Two Springfields. In Homer vs. Dignity Mrs Vanderbilt is shocked by Homer Simpson &apos;s antics twice. In The Frying Game, Mrs Vanderbilt is shown as friends with Mrs. Bellamy, Mrs. Glick and Agnes Skinner. They are a parody of the actual Vanderbilt family. [ Wendell Borton ] Wendell Borton is a perpetually nauseated and very pale boy with worried eyes and curly hair. He first appears in &quot; Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire &quot; although his first speaking appearance is in &quot; Homer&apos;s Odyssey &quot;. He becomes especially sick on field trip s, with a tendency to become even paler than usual. He makes frequent appearances at the school nurse&apos;s office at Springfield Elementary School. A classmate of Bart Simpson, Wendell is most often seen with classmates Richard, Lewis, and Martin. He voted for Martin Prince, thus making Bart lose in the class election, and ensuring Martin&apos;s victory. He is one of the few characters (like Bart, Lisa, and Maggie) whose hair is the same color as his skin. Throughout the series, Wendell has been voiced by Jo Ann Harris, Pamela Hayden, Nancy Cartwright, and Russi Taylor. [ Mr. and Mrs. Winfield ] The Winfields are an elderly couple who live next door to the Simpson family early in the series and often talk about how crude and uncivilized the family is. They first appear in the season one episode &quot; Homer&apos;s Odyssey &quot;, cracking jokes about Homer. The couple eventually move to Florida in the season four episode &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot; and have not been seen since. The couple appear in the season two episodes &quot; Simpson and Delilah &quot; and &quot; Bart&apos;s Dog Gets an F &quot;, in which the wife is revealed to be named Sylvia. She also has a small speaking role in the Season 3 episode Separate Vocations when she mistakenly thinks Bart is being arrested by the Springfield police. The couple appear in the pre-2009 opening credits of The Simpsons, during the segment where Marge and Maggie pass many characters while driving home. Matt Groening named the Winfields after friends of his. { Groening, Matt (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { The War of the Simpsons &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Wiseguy ] Raphael, a.k.a. Wiseguy, is voiced by Hank Azaria. He first appeared as the chauffeur in the second season in &quot; The Way We Was &quot;, but he has held numerous other jobs in the series. { Silverman, David (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { Old Money &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Simpsons sound editor Bob Beecher commented on alt.tv.simpsons that, &quot; He doesn&apos;t have one name. His character&apos;s name always fits the scene so he&apos;s gone by many names, &apos;Clerk&apos;, &apos;Shopkeeper&apos;, etc. But in the script the direction given to the voice is &apos;Wiseguy Voice&apos;. So call him &apos;Wiseguy&apos; if you want. &quot; [ http://snpp.com/guides/smam.file.html The Sarcastic Middle-Aged Man File The Simpsons Archive 2008-09-10 ] Azaria does a Charles Bronson -impression for the voice. { Azaria, Hank (2004).

He is a character known for bellowing &quot; Ye-e-e-s?! &quot; in a falling, then rising intonation, and appears to be highly eccentric in both his speech and appearance. The Yes Guy is a tribute to the recurring Frank Nelson character from The Jack Benny Program, I Love Lucy, and Sanford and Son, whose trademark greeting in all his characters was a loud, drawn-out &quot; Ye-e-e-s?! &quot; Inexplicably, the original character could always be found working behind the service counter of whatever shop Benny or Fred Sanford might be patronizing, and his Simpsonian counterpart is similar. In the Yes Guy&apos;s first appearance, Homer asks why his voice is always stretched, and the Yes Guy replies by saying &quot; I had a stro-o-o-oke &quot;. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Mayored to the Mob &quot; } He also appears in &quot; Homer vs. Dignity &quot;. He works at Costington&apos;s department store, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Milhouse Doesn&apos;t Live Here Anymore &quot; } works as juror number twelve of the Springfield Panel of Jury, { The Simpsons episode: &quot; } { The Monkey Suit &quot; } and as an executioner at Springfield Penitentiary. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { The Frying Game &quot; } Homer refers to him as &quot; that jerk who always goes Yessss &quot;. { The Simpsons episode: &quot; } { Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays &quot; } A Brazilian version of him was seen in &quot; Blame It on Lisa &quot;, uttering &quot; Si-i-i-m?! &quot; ( &quot; Yes &quot; in Portuguese).

The invasion phase consisted of a conventionally fought war which concluded with the capture of the Iraq capital Baghdad by United States forces. Four countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. These were the United States (148,000), United Kingdom (45,000), Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). 36 other countries were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in Kuwait by 18 February.

According to U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the coalition mission was &quot; to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein&apos;s support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people. &quot; Former chief counter-terrorism adviser on the National Security Council Richard A.

The following day coalition forces launched an incursion into Basra Province from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March the 173rd Airborne Brigade was airdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk where they joined forces with Kurdish rebels and fought several actions against the Iraqi army to secure the northern part of the country. The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the military occupation period. As of December 2011, the 2003 invasion of Iraq was the most recent armed conflict between standing national armies causing at least 1,000 battle deaths. [ Goldstein Joshua S.

It was revealed that a biological weapons (BW) program in Iraq had begun in the early 1980s with help from the United States and Britain [ October 2011 ], in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972. Details of the BW program—along with a chemical weapons program—surfaced in the wake of the Gulf War (1990–91) following investigations conducted by the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) which had been charged with the post-war disarmament of Saddam&apos;s Iraq. The investigation concluded that there was no evidence the program had continued after the war. The U.S. and its allies then maintained a policy of “ containment ” towards Iraq. This policy involved numerous economic sanctions by the UN Security Council; U.S. and UK enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones declared by the U.S. and the UK to protect Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and Shia s in the south from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government during the 1991 uprisings; and ongoing inspections.

Later that year, however, Americans began to agree with Bush&apos;s plan. The U.S. government engaged in an elaborate domestic public relations campaign to market the war to its citizens. Americans overwhelmingly believed Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction: 85% said so, even though the inspectors had not uncovered those weapons. Of those who thought Iraq had weapons sequestered somewhere, about half responded that said weapons would not be found in combat. By February 2003, 64% of Americans supported taking military action to remove Hussein from power.

Powell, in his address to the UN Security Council just before the war, referred to the aluminum tubes. A report released by the Institute for Science and International Security in 2002, however, reported that it was highly unlikely that the tubes could be used to enrich uranium.

The most relevant to this issue is Resolution 678, passed on 29 November 1990. It authorizes &quot; member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait... to use all necessary means &quot; to (1) implement Security Council Resolution 660 and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraq&apos;s occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) &quot; restore international peace and security in the area. &quot; Resolution 678 has not been rescinded or nullified by succeeding resolutions and Iraq was not alleged after 1991 to invade Kuwait or to threaten do so.

Under this reasoning, by failing to disarm and submit to weapons inspections, Iraq was in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 660 and 678, and the U.S. could legally compel Iraq&apos;s compliance through military means. Critics and proponents of the legal rationale based on the U.N. resolutions argue that the legal right to determine how to enforce its resolutions lies with the Security Council alone, not with individual nations. In February 2006, Luis Moreno Ocampo, the lead prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, reported that he had received 240 separate communications regarding the legality of the war, many of which concerned British participation in the invasion. { Richard Norton-Taylor International court hears anti-war claims in } { The Guardian 6 May 2005. } In a letter addressed to the complainants, Mr. Moreno Ocampo explained that he could only consider issues related to conduct during the war and not to its underlying legality as a possible crime of aggression because no provision had yet been adopted which &quot; defines the crime and sets out the conditions under which the Court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to it. &quot; In a March 2007 interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Moreno Ocampo encouraged Iraq to sign up with the court so that it could bring cases related to alleged war crimes. { Chamberlin, Gethin. &quot; Court &apos;can envisage&apos; Blair prosecution &quot;.

Once on the ground they prepared for the subsequent arrival of US military forces. SAD teams then combined with US Army Special Forces to organize the Kurdish Peshmerga. This joint team combined to defeat Ansar al-Islam, an ally of Al Qaida, in a battle in the northeast corner of Iraq. The US side was carried out by Paramilitary Officers from SAD and the Army&apos;s 10th Special Forces Group. SAD teams also conducted high risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions led to the initial strikes against Saddam Hussein and his key generals. Although the initial strikes against Hussein were unsuccessful in killing the dictator or his generals, it was successful in effectively ending the ability to command and control Iraqi forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command&apos;s ability to react to and maneuver against the US-led invasion force coming from the south. SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started and/or not to oppose the invasion force. NATO member Turkey refused to allow its territory to be used for the invasion. As a result, the SAD/SOG and US Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga were the entire northern force against government forces during the invasion. Their efforts kept the 5th Corps of the Iraqi army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than their moving to contest the coalition force. According to General Tommy Franks, April Fool, an American officer working undercover as a diplomat, was approached by an Iraqi intelligence agent. April Fool then sold to the Iraqi false &quot; top secret &quot; invasion plans provided by Franks&apos; team. This decoy deception successfully misled the Iraqi military into deploying major forces in Northern and Western Iraq in anticipation of attacks by way of Turkey or Jordan, which never took place.

A change in enforcement tactics was acknowledged at the time, but it was not made public that this was part of a plan known as Operation Southern Focus. The amount of ordnance dropped on Iraqi positions by Coalition aircraft in 2001 and 2002 was less than in 1999 and 2000 which was during the Clinton administration.

However, information obtained by the UK Liberal Democrats showed that the UK dropped twice as many bombs on Iraq in the second half of 2002 as they did during the whole of 2001. The tonnage of UK bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14  tons per month in May–August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6  tons in September – before Congress&apos; 11 October authorization of the invasion. The 5 September attacks included a 100+ aircraft attack on the main air defense site in western Iraq. According to an editorial in New Statesman this was &quot; Located at the furthest extreme of the southern no-fly zone, far away from the areas that needed to be patrolled to prevent attacks on the Shias, it was destroyed not because it was a threat to the patrols, but to allow allied special forces operating from Jordan to enter Iraq undetected. &quot; [ http://www.newstatesman.com/200505300013 The war before the war Michael Smith New Statesman UK 30 May 2005 6 August 2006 http://web.archive.org/web/20060813134402/http%3A//www.newstatesman.com/200505300013 13 August 2006 no ] Tommy Franks, who commanded the invasion of Iraq, has since admitted that the bombing was designed to “degrade” Iraqi air defences in the same way as the air attacks that began the 1991 Gulf War.

In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to decapitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see Shock and Awe ), attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The assumption was that superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces would allow them to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions. Following Turkey &apos;s decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south. { Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq, Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press. } Special Operations forces from the CIA and US Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in Kuwait and other Persian Gulf nations. One result of this was that one of the divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable to take part in the invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations. { NASA } { Landsat 7 image of } { Baghdad, 2 April 2003. The dark streaks are smoke from oil well fires set in an attempt to hinder attacking air forces } The invasion was swift, leading to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the military of Iraq in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had set many oil wells on fire in an attempt to disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi forces had mined some 400 oil wells around Basra and the Al-Faw peninsula with explosives. Coalition troops launched an air and amphibious assault on the Al-Faw peninsula during the closing hours of 19 March to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the Royal Navy, Polish Navy, and Royal Australian Navy. British 3 Commando Brigade, with the United States Marine Corps &apos; 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and the Polish Special Forces unit GROM attached, attacked the port of Umm Qasr. There they met with heavy resistance by Iraqi troops. A total of 14 Coalition troops and 30–40 Iraqi troops were killed, and 450 Iraqis taken prisoner. The British Army &apos;s 16 Air Assault Brigade also secured the oil fields in southern Iraq in places like Rumaila while the Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction. Despite the rapid advance of the invasion forces, some 44 oil wells were destroyed and set ablaze by Iraqi explosives or by incidental fire. However, the wells were quickly capped and the fires put out, preventing the ecological damage and loss of oil production capacity that had occurred at the end of the Gulf War. In keeping with the rapid advance plan, the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force moved along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and 1 (UK) Armoured Division moved northward through the eastern marshland. During the first week of the war, Iraqi forces fired a Scud missile at the American Battlefield Update Assessment center in Camp Doha, Kuwait. The missile was intercepted and shot down by a Patriot missile seconds before hitting the complex. Subsequently, two A-10 Warthog s bombed the missile launcher. [ Battle of Nasiriyah ] [ Battle of Nasiriyah ] Initially, the U.S. 1st Marine Division fought through the Rumaila oil field s, and moved north to Nasiriyah —a moderate-sized, Shi&apos;ite dominated city with important strategic significance as a major road junction and its proximity to nearby Talil Airfield. It was also situated near a number of strategically important bridges over the Euphrates River. The city was defended by a mix of regular Iraqi army units, Ba&apos;ath loyalists, and Fedayeen from both Iraq and abroad. The United States Army 3rd Infantry Division defeated Iraqi forces entrenched in and around the airfield and bypassed the city to the west. A U.S. amphibious fighting vehicle destroyed near Nasiriyah On 23 March, a convoy from the 3rd Infantry Division, including the female American soldiers Jessica Lynch and Lori Piestewa, was ambushed after taking a wrong turn into the city. Eleven U.S. soldiers were killed, and seven, including Lynch and Piestewa, were captured.

Piestewa, who was from Tuba City, Arizona, and an enrolled member of the Hopi Tribe, was believed to have been the first Native American woman killed in combat in a foreign war. On the same day, U.S Marines from the Second Marine Division entered Nasiriyah in force, facing heavy resistance as they moved to secure two major bridges in the city. Several Marines were killed during a firefight with Fedayeen in the urban fighting. At the Saddam Canal, another 18 Marines were killed in heavy fighting with Iraqi soldiers. An Air Force A-10 was involved in a case of friendly fire that resulted in the death of six Marines when it accidentally attacked an American amphibious vehicle. Two other vehicles were destroyed when a barrage of RPG and small arms fire killed most of the Marines inside.

The bridges were secured and the Second Marine division set up an perimeter around the city. { Rumaila oil field, April 2, 2003 } On the evening of 24 March, a battalion of the 1st Marine Regiment pushed through Nasiriyah and established a perimeter 15  kilometers (9.3  miles) north of the city. Iraqi reinforcements from Kut launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200–300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi Fedayeen continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights in which large numbers of Fedayeen were killed. Because of Nasiriyah&apos;s strategic position as a road junction, a significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the city&apos;s surrounding highways. With the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured, Coalition forces gained an important logistical center in southern Iraq and established FOB/EAF Jalibah, some [ 10 mi km ] outside of Nasiriyah. Additional troops and supplies were soon brought through this forward operating base. The 101st Airborne Division continued its attack north in support of the 3rd Infantry Division. By 28 March, a severe sand storm slowed the Coalition advance as the 3rd Infantry Division halted its northward drive half way between Najaf and Karbala. As a result of heavy rains that occurred along with the sand storm, orange-colored mud fell on some parts of the invasion force in the area. Air operations by helicopters, poised to bring reinforcements from the 101st Airborne, were blocked for three days. There was particularly heavy fighting in and around the bridge near the town of Kufl. [ Battle of Najaf ] [ Battle of Najaf (2003) ] { Najaf } Another fierce battle was at Najaf, where U.S. airborne and armored units with British air support fought an intense battle with Iraqi Regulars, Republican Guard units, and paramilitary forces. It started with U.S. AH-64 Apache helicopter gunships setting out on a mission to attack Republican Guard armored units, and while flying low, came under heavy anti-aircraft, small arms, and RPG fire which disrupted the attack and led to one of the gunships down and many heavily damaged.

A joint Polish-British-American force ran into unexpectedly stiff resistance, and it took several days to clear the Iraqi forces out. Farther north, the British 7 Armoured Brigade ( &quot; The Desert Rats &quot; ), fought their way into Iraq&apos;s second-largest city, Basra, on 6 April, coming under constant attack by regulars and Fedayeen, while 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (the British Red Devils ) cleared the &apos;old quarter&apos; of the city that was inaccessible to vehicles. Entering Basra was achieved after two weeks of fierce fighting, which included the biggest tank battle by British forces since World War II when the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks on 27 March. Elements of 1 (UK) Armoured Division began to advance north towards U.S. positions around Al Amarah on 9 April. Pre-existing electrical and water shortages continued throughout the conflict and looting began as Iraqi forces collapsed. While Coalition forces began working with local Iraqi Police to enforce order, a joint team composed of Royal Engineers and the Royal Logistics Corps of the British Army rapidly set up and repaired dockyard facilities to allow humanitarian aid to begin to arrive from ships arriving in the port city of Umm Qasr. After a rapid initial advance, the first major pause occurred near Karbala. There, U.S. Army elements met resistance from Iraqi troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north. Eventually, troops from the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S Army secured the cities of Najaf and Karbala to prevent any Iraqi counterattacks on the 3rd Infantry Division&apos;s lines of communication as the division pressed its advance toward Baghdad. A total of 11 British soldiers were killed, while 395–515 Iraqi soldiers, irregulars, and Fedayeen were killed. [ Battle of Karbala ] [ Battle of Karbala (2003) ] Mural of Saddam Hussein vandalized in Karabala, April 2003. The Karbala Gap was a 20-25-mile wide strip of land with the Euphrates River to the east and Lake Razazah to the west. This strip of land was recognized by Iraqi commanders as a key approach to Baghdad, and was defended by some of the best units of the Iraqi Republican Guard. The Iraqi high command had originally positioned two Republican Guard divisions blocking the Karbala Gap.

However, the Coalition had since the beginning of March been conducting a strategic deception operation to convince the Iraqis that the U.S. 4th Infantry Division would be mounting a major assault into northern Iraq from Turkey. [ http://www.jewishworldreview.com/michael/kelly1.asp#3.%20Across The Euphrates &amp; #124; Michael Kelly Jewishworldreview.com 3 April 2003 15 January 2011 ] This deception plan worked, and on 2 April Saddam&apos;s son Qusay Hussein declared that the American invasion from the south was a feint and ordered troops to be re-deployed from the Karbala front to the north of Baghdad. Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was in command of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib. At Musayib, U.S. troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time. The 10th Armored Brigade from the Medina Division and the 22nd Armored Brigade from the Nebuchadnezzar Division, supported by artillery, launched night attacks against the U.S. bridgehead at Musayib. The attack was repulsed using tank fire and massed artillery rockets, destroying or disabling every Iraqi tank in the assault. The next morning, Coalition aircraft and helicopters fired on the Republican Guard units, destroying many more vehicles as well as communications infrastructure. The Republican Guard units broke under the massed firepower and lost any sense of command and cohesion and the U.S. forces poured through gap on to Baghdad. [ Special operations ] The northern front during March and April 2003 The 2nd Battalion of the U.S. 5th Special Forces Group, United States Army Special Forces (Green Berets) conducted reconnaissance in the cities of Basra, Karbala and various other locations. In the North, the 10th Special Forces Group (10th SFG) and CIA paramilitary officers from their Special Activities Division had the mission of aiding the Kurdish parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, de facto rulers of Iraqi Kurdistan since 1991, and employing them against the 13 Iraqi Divisions located near Kirkuk and Mosul. Turkey had officially prohibited any Coalition troops from using their bases or airspace, so lead elements of the 10th SFG had to make a detour infiltration; their flight was supposed to take four hours but instead took ten. Hours after the first of such flights, Turkey did allow the use of its air space and the rest of the 10th SFG infiltrated in. The preliminary mission was to destroy the base of the Kurdish terrorist group Ansar al-Islam, believed to be linked to al-Qaeda. Concurrent and follow-on missions involved attacking and fixing Iraqi forces in the north, thus preventing their deployment to the southern front and the main effort of the invasion. On 26 March 2003, the 173rd Airborne Brigade augmented the invasion&apos;s northern front by parachuting into northern Iraq onto Bashur Airfield, controlled at the time by elements of 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga. The fall of Kirkuk on 10 April 2003 to the 10th SFG, CIA Paramilitary Teams and Kurdish peshmerga precipitated the 173rd&apos;s planned assault, preventing the unit&apos;s involvement in combat against Iraqi forces during the invasion. The successful occupation of Kirkuk came as a result of approximately two weeks of fighting that included the Battle of the Green Line (the unofficial border of the Kurdish autonomous zone) and the subsequent Battle of Kani Domlan Ridge (the ridgeline running northwest to southeast of Kirkuk), the latter fought exclusively by 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga against the Iraqi I Corps. The 173rd Brigade would eventually take responsibility for Kirkuk days later, becoming involved in the counterinsurgency fight and remain there until redeploying a year later. Further reinforcing operations in Northern Iraq, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), serving as Landing Force Sixth Fleet, deployed in April to Erbil and subsequently Mosul via Marine KC-130 flights. The 26 MEU (SOC) maintained security of the Mosul airfield and surrounding area until relief by the 101st Airborne Division. After Sargat was taken, Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and CIA paramilitary officers along with their Kurdish allies pushed south towards Tikrit and the surrounding towns of Northern Iraq. Previously, during the Battle of the Green Line, Bravo Company, 3/10 with their Kurdish allies pushed back, destroyed, or routed the 13th Iraqi Infantry Division. The same company took Tikrit. Iraq was the largest deployment of the U.S. Special Forces since Vietnam.

Units of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard led the defence of the city. The rest of the defenders were a mixture of Republican Guard units, regular army units, Fedayeen Saddam, and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces. This plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guard&apos;s assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. On 5 April, Task Force 1–64 Armor of the U.S. Army&apos;s 3rd Infantry Division executed a raid, later called the &quot; Thunder Run &quot;, to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 Bradley armored fighting vehicles advancing to the Baghdad airport. They met heavy resistance, but were successful in reaching the airport. U.S. troops faced heavy fighting in the airport, and were even temporarily pushed out, but eventually secured the airport. { 1st Battalion 7th Marines enter a palace during the } { Battle of Baghdad } The next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division attacked into downtown Baghdad and occupied one of the palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown. On 10 April, a rumor emerged that Saddam Hussein and his top aides were in a mosque complex in the Al Az&apos;Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three companies of Marines were sent to capture him and came under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed. { toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue in } { Firdos Square in Baghdad shortly after the } { capture of the city } Many Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his cult of personality. One widely publicized event was the dramatic toppling of a large statue of Saddam in Baghdad&apos;s Firdos Square. This attracted considerable media coverage at the time. As the British Daily Mirror reported, &quot; For an oppressed people this final act in the fading daylight, the wrenching down of this ghastly symbol of the regime, is their Berlin Wall moment. Big Moustache has had his day. &quot; { Anton Antonowicz, ‘Toppling Saddam&apos;s Statue Is The Final Triumph For These Oppressed People’ in The Mirror, 10 April 2003. } As Staff Sergeant Brian Plesich reported in On Point: The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom, &quot; The Marine Corps colonel in the area saw the Saddam statue as a target of opportunity and decided that the statue must come down. Since we were right there, we chimed in with some loudspeaker support to let the Iraqis know what it was we were attempting to do... &quot; &quot; Somehow along the way, somebody had gotten the idea to put a bunch of Iraqi kids onto the wrecker that was to pull the statue down. While the wrecker was pulling the statue down, there were Iraqi children crawling all over it. Finally they brought the statue down &quot; { Staff Sergeant Brian Plesich, team leader, Tactical Psychological Operations Team 1153, 305th Psychological Operations Company, interview by Lieutenant Colonel Dennis Cahill, 31 May 2003 in Col. Gregory Fontenot, Lt. Col. E.J. Degen, and Lt. Col. David Tohn: ‘On Point: The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom’, Chapter 6 ‘Regime Collapse’ } The fall of Baghdad saw the outbreak of regional, sectarian violence throughout the country, as Iraqi tribes and cities began to fight each other over old grudges. The Iraqi cities of Al-Kut and Nasiriyah launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of the new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued. thumb U.S. General Tommy Franks assumed control of Iraq as the supreme commander of the coalition occupation forces. Shortly after the sudden collapse of the defense of Baghdad, rumors were circulating in Iraq and elsewhere that there had been a deal struck (a &quot; safqua &quot; ) wherein the U.S.-led Coalition had bribed key members of the Iraqi military elite and/or the Ba&apos;ath party itself to stand down. In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led Coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear. U.S.-led Coalition troops promptly began searching for the key members of Saddam Hussein&apos;s government. These individuals were identified by a variety of means, most famously through sets of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. Later during the military occupation period after the invasion, on 22 July 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from Task Force 20, Saddam Hussein&apos;s sons Uday and Qusay, and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight. Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003 by the U.S. Army&apos;s 4th Infantry Division and members of Task Force 121 during Operation Red Dawn. [ Other areas ] { Diwaniyah } In the north, Kurdish forces opposed to Saddam Hussein had already occupied for years an autonomous area in northern Iraq. With the assistance of U.S. Special Forces and air strikes, they were able to rout the Iraqi units near them and to occupy oil-rich Kirkuk on 10 April. U.S. special forces had also been involved in the extreme south of Iraq, attempting to occupy key roads to Syria and airbases. In one case two armored platoons were used to convince Iraqi leadership that an entire armored battalion was entrenched in the west of Iraq. On 15 April, U.S. forces took control of Tikrit, the last major outpost in central Iraq, with an attack led by the Marines&apos; Task Force Tripoli. About a week later the Marines were relieved in place by the Army&apos;s 4th Infantry Division.

The invasion did require a large army build-up like the 1991 Gulf War, but many did not see combat and many were withdrawn after the invasion ended. This proved to be short-sighted, however, due to the requirement for a much larger force to combat the irregular Iraqi forces in the aftermath of the war. General Eric Shinseki, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, recommended &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; { Dave Moniz, USA TODAY, 2 June 2003 } troops be used to maintain post-war order, but then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld —and especially his deputy, civilian Paul Wolfowitz —strongly disagreed. General Abizaid later said General Shinseki had been right.

Attacks on U.S. supply routes by Fedayeen militiamen were repulsed. The Iraqis&apos; artillery proved largely ineffective, and they were unable to mobilize their air force to attempt a defense. The Iraqi T-72 tanks, the most powerful armored vehicles in the Iraqi army, were both outdated and ill-maintained, and when they were mobilized they were rapidly destroyed, thanks in part to the Coalition air supremacy. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Naval Aviation, and British Royal Air Force operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended resistance targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived. The main battle tank s of the U.S. and UK forces, the U.S. M1 Abrams and British Challenger 2, proved worthy in the rapid advance across the country. With the large number of RPG attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few U.S. and UK tanks were lost and no tank crew were killed by hostile fire. The only tank loss sustained by the British Army was a Challenger 2 of the Queen&apos;s Royal Lancers that was hit by another Challenger 2, killing two crew members. The Iraqi army suffered from poor morale, even amongst the elite Republican Guard. Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon the approach of invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces to surrender. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. Worse, the Iraqi army had incompetent leadership – reports state that Qusay Hussein, charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units within were both confused and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target-points rather than seek engagements with Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war fully intact and without ever having been engaged by U.S. forces, especially in southern Iraq. It is assumed that most units disintegrated to return to their homes. According to the declassified Pentagon report, &quot; The largest contributing factor to the complete defeat of Iraq&apos;s military forces was the continued interference by Saddam. &quot; The report, designed to help U.S. officials understand in hindsight how Saddam and his military commanders prepared for and fought the invasion, paints a picture of an Iraqi government blind to the threat it faced, hampered by Saddam&apos;s inept military leadership and deceived by its own propaganda and inability to believe the United States would invade a sovereign country without provocation. According to the BBC, the report portrays Saddam Hussein as &quot; chronically out of touch with reality – preoccupied with the prevention of domestic unrest and with the threat posed by Iran. &quot; [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4843394.stm Russia denies Iraq secrets claim BBC News 25 March 2006 7 August 2006 ] [ Casualties ] [ Casualties in the conflict in Iraq Humanitarian Crises of the Iraq War ] [ Death toll ] A US Navy (USN) Hospital Corpsman and Iraqi doctor, provide medical aid to an Iraqi civilian, injured during fighting near Umm Qasr, Iraq, in March 2003 While estimates on the number of casualties during the invasion in Iraq vary widely, the majority of deaths and injuries have occurred after U.S. President Bush declared the end of &quot; major combat operations &quot; on 1 May 2003. { Reuters, &quot; Getting amputees back on their feet &quot;. } { Washington Post. 25 Oct. 2005. } According to CNN, the U.S. government reported that 139 U.S. military personnel were killed before 1 May 2003, while over 4,000 have been killed since 2003.

[ Criticism ] [ Criticism of the Iraq War ] Opponents of military intervention in Iraq have attacked the decision to invade Iraq along a number of lines, including calling into question the evidence used to justify the war, arguing for continued diplomacy, challenging the war’s legality, suggesting that the U.S. had other more pressing security priorities, (i.e. Afghanistan and North Korea ) and predicting that the war would destabilize the Middle East region. The breadth and depth of the criticism was particularly notable in comparison with the first Gulf War, which met with considerably less domestic and international opposition, although the geopolitical situation had evolved since the last decade. [ Rationale based on faulty evidence ] The central U.S. justification for launching the Iraq War was that Saddam Hussein&apos;s alleged development of nuclear and biological weapons and purported ties to al-Qaeda made his regime a &quot; grave and growing &quot; [ http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020912-1.html President&apos;s Remarks at the United Nations General Assembly, 12 September 2002 29 October 2011 ] threat to the United States and the world community.

Concerning Iraq’s weapons programs, prominent critics included Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector who argued in 2002 that inspections had eliminated the nuclear and chemical weapons programs, and that evidence of their reconstitution would “have been eminently detectable by intelligence services ….” Although it is popularly believed that Saddam Hussein had forced the IAEA weapons inspectors to leave Iraq, they were in fact withdrawn at the request of US Ambassador Peter Burleigh in advance of Operation Desert Fox, the 1998 American bombing campaign. After the build-up of U.S. troops in neighboring states, Hussein welcomed them back and promised complete cooperation with their demands. Experienced IAEA inspection teams were already back in Iraq and had made some interim reports on its search for various forms of WMD.

Feith, manipulated evidence to support links between al-Qaeda and Iraq. { Pincus, Walter and R. Jeffrey Smith. “Official’s Key Report on Iraq is Faulted. The Washington Post, Friday, 9 February 2007; Page A01 } [ Lack of a U.N. mandate ] One of the main questions in the lead-up to the war was whether the United Nations Security Council would authorize military intervention in Iraq. When it became increasingly clear that U.N. authorization would require significant further weapons inspections, and that the U.S. and the UK planned to invade Iraq regardless, many criticized their effort as unwise, immoral, and illegal. Robin Cook, then the leader of the United Kingdom House of Commons and a former foreign secretary, resigned from Tony Blair&apos;s cabinet in protest over the UK’s decision to invade without the authorization of a U.N. resolution. Cook said at the time that: &quot; In principle I believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support. In practice I believe it is against Britain&apos;s interests to create a precedent for unilateral military action.” { Tempest, Matthew. “Cook resigns from cabinet over Iraq”. The Guardian, 17 March 2003. Retrieved on 17 April 2007. } In addition, senior government legal advisor Elizabeth Wilmshurst resigned, stating her legal opinion that an invasion would be illegal. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in an interview with the BBC in September 2004, &quot; [F]rom our point of view and from the Charter point of view [the war] was illegal. &quot; [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661640.stm Excerpts: Annan interview 16 September 2004 BBC News 7 August 2007 ] This drew immediate criticism from the United States and was immediately played down. &quot; [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25685-2004Sep16.html U.S., Allies Dispute Annan on Iraq War Colum Lynch Washington Post 17 September 2004 A18 25 May 2006 ] His annual report to the General Assembly for 2003 included no more than the statement: &quot; Following the end of major hostilities which resulted in the occupation of Iraq... &quot; [ A-58-1 Document General Assembly 58 9 8 August 2007 28 August 2003 ] A similar report from the Security Council was similarly terse in its reference to the event: &quot; Following the cessation of hostilities in Iraq in April 2003... &quot; [ A-58-2 Document General Assembly 58 20 8 August 2007 23 September 2003 ] However, some argue that Kofi Annan was simply picking sides and playing politics. The United Nations Security Council has passed nearly 60 resolutions on Iraq and Kuwait since Iraq&apos;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The most relevant to this issue is Resolution 678, passed on 29 November 1990. It authorizes &quot; member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait... to use all necessary means &quot; to (1) implement Security Council Resolution 660 and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraq&apos;s occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) &quot; restore international peace and security in the area. &quot; However, the phrase &quot; restore international peace and security in the area &quot; was widely understood to refer to Iraq&apos;s invasion of Kuwait and was not a blank check for future military aggression against Iraq. [ Military intervention vs diplomatic solution ] { Dominique de Villepin&apos;s speech at the U.N. Security Council (14 February 2003) } Criticisms about the evidence used to justify the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort. This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, who responded to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell&apos;s 5 February 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: &quot; Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq&apos;s part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement of the means of inspections. &quot; { “Nations take sides after Powell&apos;s speech”. CNN.com, 6 February 2003.

Anti-French propangada exploiting the classic Francophobic clichés immediately ensued in the United States and the United Kingdom. A call for a boycott on French wine was launched in the United States and the New York Post covered on the 1944 &quot; Sacrifice &quot; of the GIs France would had forgotten. It was followed a week later, on 20 February, by the British newspaper The Sun publishing a special issue entitled &quot; Chirac is a worm &quot; and including ad hominem attacks such as &quot; Jacques Chirac has become the shame of Europe &quot;. { 20 heures le journal : émission du 20 février 2003 (National Audiovisual Institute archives), French news national edition, France 2 French public channel, 20 February 2003 } Actually both newspapers expressed the opinion of their owner, U.S. billionaire Rupert Murdoch, a military intervention supporter and a George W. Bush partisan as argued by Roy Greenslade in The Guardian published on 17 February.

Bush often describes the Iraq War as a “central front in the war on terror ”. { Office of the Press Secretary. President Addresses Nation, Discusses Iraq, War on Terror &quot;. White House Press Release, 28 June 2005. Retrieved on 17 April 2007. } Some critics of the war, particularly within the U.S. military community, argued pointedly against the conflation of Iraq and the war on terror, and criticized Bush for losing focus on the more important objective of fighting al-Qaeda. As Marine Lieut. General Greg Newbold, the Pentagon&apos;s former top operations officer, wrote in a 2006 TIME article, “I now regret that I did not more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were peripheral to the real threat—al-Qaeda.” { Newbold, Greg. &quot; Why Iraq Was a Mistake &quot;. Time Magazine, 9 April 2006. Retrieved on 16 April 2007. } Critics within this vein have further argued that containment would have been an effective strategy for the Hussein government, and that the top U.S. priorities in the Middle East should be encouraging a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, working for the moderation of Iran, and solidifying gains made in Afghanistan and Central Asia. In an October 2002 speech, Retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, former head of Central Command for U.S. forces in the Middle East and State Department&apos;s envoy to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, called Iraq “maybe six or seven,” in terms of U.S. Middle East priorities, adding that “the affordability line may be drawn around five.” { Boehlert, Eric. &quot; I&apos;m not sure which planet they live on &quot;. Salon, 17 October 20002. Retrieved 17 April 2007. } However, while commander of CENTCOM, Zinni held a very different opinion concerning the threat posed by Iraq. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2000, Zinni said: “Iraq remains the most significant near-term threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region. This is primarily due to its large conventional military force, pursuit of WMD, oppressive treatment of Iraqi citizens, refusal to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR), persistent threats to enforcement of the No Fly Zones (NFZ), and continued efforts to violate UN Security Council sanctions through oil smuggling.” [ http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/2000/000229az.pdf Statement of General Anthony C.

[ Potential to destabilize the region ] Besides arguing that Iraq was not the top strategic priority in the war on terrorism or in the Middle East, critics of the war also suggested that it could potentially destabilize the surrounding region. Prominent among such critics was Brent Scowcroft, who served as National Security Advisor to George H. W. Bush. In an 15 August 2002 Wall Street Journal editorial entitled &quot; Don&apos;t attack Saddam, &quot; Scowcroft wrote that, “Possibly the most dire consequences would be the effect in the region... there would be an explosion of outrage against us... the results could well destabilize Arab regimes”, and, “could even swell the ranks of the terrorists.” { Scowcroft, Brent. &quot; Don&apos;t attack Saddam &quot;.

However this was quickly changed to &quot; Operation Iraqi Freedom. &quot; Also notable was the usage &quot; death squad s &quot; to refer to Fedayeen paramilitary forces. Members of the Saddam Hussein government were called by disparaging nicknames – e.g., &quot; Chemical Ali &quot; ( Ali Hassan al-Majid ), &quot; Baghdad Bob &quot; or &quot; Comical Ali &quot; ( Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf ), and &quot; Mrs. Anthrax &quot; or &quot; Chemical Sally &quot; ( Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash ).

What is now France made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as Gaul. Roman writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the Gauls, the Aquitani, and the Belgae. The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were a Celtic people speaking what is known as the Gaulish language. Over the course of the first millennium BC the Greeks, Romans, and Carthaginians established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and the offshore islands. The Roman Republic annexed southern Gaul as the province of Gallia Narbonensis in the late 2nd century BC, and Roman forces under Julius Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul in the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC. Afterwards a Gallo-Roman culture emerged and Gaul was increasingly integrated into the Roman Empire. In the later stages of the Roman Empire, Gaul was subject to barbarian raids and migration, most importantly by the Germanic Franks. The Frankish king Clovis I united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century, setting the stage for Frankish dominance in the region for hundreds of years. Frankish power reached its fullest extent under Charlemagne. The medieval Kingdom of France emerged out of the western part of Charlemagne&apos;s Carolingian Empire, known as West Francia, and achieved increasing prominence under the rule of the House of Capet, founded by Hugh Capet in 987. A succession crisis following the death of the last Capetian monarch in 1337 led to the series of conflicts known as the Hundred Years War between the House of Valois and the House of Plantagenet. The wars ended with a Valois victory in 1453, solidifying the power of the Ancien Régime as a highly centralized absolute monarchy. During the next centuries, France experienced the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation, as well as recurring religious conflicts and wars with other powers. A burgeoning worldwide colonial empire was established from the 16th century. In the late 18th century the monarchy and associated institutions were overthrown in the French Revolution, which forever changed French and world history. The country was governed for a period as a Republic, until the French Empire was declared by Napoleon Bonaparte. Following Napoleon&apos;s defeat in the Napoleonic Wars France went through several further regime changes, being ruled as a monarchy, then briefly as a Second Republic, and then as a Second Empire, until a more lasting Third French Republic was established in 1870. France was one of the Triple Entente powers in World War I, fighting alongside the United Kingdom, Russia, and their allies against the Central Powers. It was one of the Allied Powers in World War II, but was conquered by Nazi Germany within two months. The Third Republic was dismantled, and most of the country was controlled directly by the Axis Powers, while the south was controlled by the collaborationist Vichy government. Following liberation, a Fourth Republic was established; this was succeeded in 1958 by the French Fifth Republic, the country&apos;s current government. After the war decolonization saw most of the French colonial empire become independent, while other parts were incorporated into the French state as overseas department s and collectivities. Since World War II France has been a leading member in the UN, the European Union and NATO, and remains a strong economic, cultural, military and political influence in the 21st century. [ Prehistory ] Cave painting in Lascaux. &lt; /s &gt; [ Prehistory of France ] The Neanderthal s, a member of the homo genus, were present in Europe from about 200,000 BC, but died out about 30,000 years ago, possibly out-competed by the modern humans during a period of cold weather. The earliest modern humans – Homo sapiens – entered Europe (including France) around 50,000 years ago (the Upper Palaeolithic ). The cave paintings of Lascaux and Gargas (Gargas in the Hautes-Pyrénées ) as well as the Carnac stones are remains of the local prehistoric activity. [ Ancient history ] [ Greek colonies ] [ Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies ] In 600 BC, Ionia n Greeks, originating from Phocaea, founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille ), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, making it the oldest city of France. [ I. E. S. Edwards, ed. The Cambridge Ancient History http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dn1TmVvMwmo4C%26amp%3Bpg%3DRA1-PA754 1970 Cambridge U.P. 754 ] [ Claude Orrieux Pauline Schmitt Pantel A History of Ancient Greece http://books.google.com/books?id%3Db8cA8hymTw8C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA62 1999 Blackwell 62 ] At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated some parts of the current territory of France, but this occupation spread in the rest of France only between the 5th and 3rd century BC. { Carpentier et al 2000, p.29 } [ Gaul ] [ Gaul ] { Massalia (modern } { Marseille ) silver coin with Greek legend, a testimony to } { Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul, 5th–1st century BCE. } Covering large parts of modern day France, Belgium, northwest Germany and northern Italy, Gaul was inhabited by many Celtic and Belgae tribes whom the Romans referred to as Gauls and who spoke the Gaulish language roughly between the Seine and the Garonne (Gallia Celtica). On the lower Garonne the people spoke Aquitanian, an archaic language related to Basque whereas a Belgian language was spoken north of Lutecia. The Celts founded cities such as Lutetia Parisiorum (Paris) and Burdigala (Bordeaux) while the Aquitanians founded Tolosa (Toulouse). Long before any Roman settlements, Greek navigators settled in what would become Provence. The Phoceans founded important cities such as Massalia (Marseille) and Nikaia (Nice), bringing them in to conflict with the neighboring Celts and Ligurians. Some Phocean great navigators, such as Pytheas, were born in Marseille. The Celts themselves often fought with Aquitanians and Germans, and a Gaulish war band led by Brennus invaded Rome c. 393 or 388 BC following the Battle of the Allia. However, the tribal society of the Gauls did not change fast enough for the centralized Roman state, who would learn to counter them. The Gaulish tribal confederacies were then defeated by the Romans in battles such as Sentinum and Telamon. In the early 3rd century BC, the Belgae conquered the surrounding territories of the Somme in northern Gaul after a battle supposedly against the Armoricani near Ribemont-sur-Ancre and Gournay-sur-Aronde, where sanctuaries were found. When Carthaginian commander Hannibal Barca fought the Romans, he recruited several Gaulish mercenaries who fought on his side at Cannae. It was this Gaulish participation that caused Provence to be annexed in 122 BC by the Roman Republic. [ December 2008 ] Later, the Consul of Gaul— Julius Caesar —conquered all of Gaul. Despite Gaulish opposition led by Vercingetorix, the Overking of the Warriors, the Gauls succumbed to the Roman onslaught. The Gauls had some success at first at Gergovia, but were ultimately defeated at Alesia. The Romans founded cities such as Lugdunum (Lyon) and Narbonensis (Narbonne). [ Roman Gaul ] [ Roman Gaul ] { Vercingetorix surrenders to } { Julius Caesar after } { Alesia. Painting by Lionel-Noël Royer, 1899. } Gaul was divided into several different provinces. The Romans displaced populations to prevent local identities from becoming a threat to Roman control. Thus, many Celts were displaced in Aquitania or were enslaved and moved out of Gaul. There was a strong cultural evolution in Gaul under the Roman Empire, the most obvious one being the replacement of the Gaulish language by Vulgar Latin. It has been argued the similarities between the Gaulish and Latin languages favoured the transition. Gaul remained under Roman control for centuries and Celtic culture was then gradually replaced by Gallo-Roman culture. The Gauls became better integrated with the Empire with the passage of time. For instance, Marcus Antonius Primus, an important general of the Roman Empire, and Emperor Claudius were both born in Gaul, as were general Gnaeus Julius Agricola and emperor Caracalla. Antoninus Pius also came from a Gaulish family. In the decade following Valerian &apos;s capture by the Persians in 260, Postumus established a short-lived Gallic Empire, which included the Iberian Peninsula and Britannia, in addition to Gaul itself. Germanic tribes, the Franks and the Alamanni, entered Gaul at this time. The Gallic Empire ended with Emperor Aurelian &apos;s victory at Châlons in 274. Gaulish soldiers. A migration of Celts appeared in the 4th century in Armorica. They were led by the legendary king Conan Meriadoc and came from Britain. They spoke the now extinct British language, which evolved into the Breton, Cornish, and Welsh language s. In 418 the Aquitanian province was given to the Goths in exchange for their support against the Vandals. Those same Goths had previously sacked Rome in 410 and established a capital in Toulouse. The Roman Empire had difficulty responding to all the barbarian raids, and Flavius Aëtius had to use these tribes against each other in order to maintain some Roman control. He first used the Huns against the Burgundians, and these mercenaries destroyed Worms, killed king Gunther, and pushed the Burgundians westward. The Burgundians were resettled by Aëtius near Lugdunum in 443. The Huns, united by Attila became a greater threat, and Aëtius used the Visigoths against the Huns. The conflict climaxed in 451 at the Battle of Châlons, in which the Romans and Goths defeated Attila. The Roman Empire was on the verge of collapsing. Aquitania was definitely abandoned to the Visigoths, who would soon conquer a significant part of southern Gaul as well as most of the Iberian Peninsula. The Burgundians claimed their own kingdom, and northern Gaul was practically abandoned to the Franks. Aside from the Germanic peoples, the Vascones entered Wasconia from the Pyrenees and the Bretons formed three kingdoms in Armorica: Domnonia, Cornouaille and Broërec. { P. J. Heather, The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History of Rome and the Barbarians (2007) } [ Frankish kingdoms (486–987) ] [ Frankish Empire ] [ List of Frankish Kings Merovingian Carolingian Renaissance Early Middle Ages ] { Battle of Tours. This battle is often considered of macro-importance in European and Islamic history. } In 486, Clovis I, leader of the Salian Franks, defeated Syagrius at Soissons and subsequently united most of northern and central Gaul under his rule. Clovis then recorded a succession of victories against other Germanic tribes such as the Alamanni at Tolbiac. In 496, pagan Clovis adopted Catholicism. This gave him greater legitimacy and power over his Christian subjects and granted him clerical support against the Arian Visigoths. He defeated Alaric II at Vouillé in 507 and annexed Aquitaine, and thus Toulouse, into his Frankish kingdom. The Goths retired to Toledo in what would become Spain. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian Dynasty but his kingdom would not survive his death. Under Frankish inheritance traditions, all sons would inherit part of the land, so four kingdoms emerged: centered on Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. Over time, the borders and numbers of Frankish kingdoms were fluid and changed frequently. Also during this time, the Mayors of the Palace, originally the chief advisor to the kings, would become the real power in the Frankish lands; the Merovingian kings themselves would be reduced to little more than figureheads. { Edward James, The Franks (1991) } By this time Muslim invaders had conquered Hispania and were threatening the Frankish kingdoms. Duke Odo the Great defeated a major invading force at Toulouse in 721 but failed to repel a raiding party in 732. The mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated that raiding party at the Battle of Tours (actually the battle took place between Tours and Poitiers) and earned respect and power within the Frankish Kingdom. The assumption of the crown in 751 by Pepin the Short (son of Charles Martel) established the Carolingian dynasty as the Kings of the Franks. { Charlemagne } Carolingian power reached its fullest extent under Pepin&apos;s son, Charlemagne. In 771, Charlemagne reunited the Frankish domains after a further period of division, subsequently conquering the Lombards under Desiderius in what is now northern Italy (774), incorporating Bavaria (788) into his realm, defeating the Avars of the Danubian plain (796), advancing the frontier with Islamic Spain as far south as Barcelona (801), and subjugating Lower Saxony (804) after a prolonged campaign. In recognition of his successes and his political support for the Papacy, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans, or Roman Emperor in the West, by Pope Leo III in 800. Charlemagne&apos;s son Louis the Pious (emperor 814–840) kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive Louis I&apos;s death. Two of his sons – Charles the Bald and Louis the German – swore allegiance to each other against their brother – Lothair I – in the Oaths of Strasbourg, and the empire was divided among Louis&apos;s three sons ( Treaty of Verdun, 843). After a last brief reunification (884–887), the imperial title ceased to be held in the western realm, which was to form the basis of the future French kingdom. The eastern realm, which would become Germany, elected the Saxon dynasty of Henry the Fowler. { Derek Wilson, Charlemagne (2007) } Under the Carolingian s, the kingdom was ravaged by Viking raiders. In this struggle some important figures such as Count Odo of Paris and his brother King Robert rose to fame and became kings. This emerging dynasty, whose members were called the Robertines, were the predecessors of the Capetian Dynasty. Led by Rollo, some Vikings had settled in Normandy and were granted the land, first as counts and then as dukes, by King Charles the Simple, in order to protect the land from other raiders. The people that emerged from the interactions between the new Viking aristocracy and the already mixed Franks and Gallo-Romans became known as the Normans. [ Elisabeth M. C. Van Houts The Normans in Europe http://books.google.com/books?id%3DIarkHmOdjnsC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA23 2000 Manchester U.P. 23 ] [ State building into the Kingdom of France (987–1453) ] [ France in the Middle Ages ] France was a very decentralised state during the Middle Ages. The authority of the king was more religious than administrative. The 11th century in France marked the apogee of princely power at the expense of the king when states like Normandy, Flanders or Languedoc enjoyed a local authority comparable to kingdoms in all but name. The Capetians, as they were descended from the Robertines, were formerly powerful princes themselves who had successfully unseated the weak and unfortunate Carolingian kings. The Carolingian Kings had nothing more than a royal title when the Capetian Kings added their principality to that title. The Capetians, in a way, held a dual status of King and Prince; as king they held the Crown of Charlemagne and as Count of Paris they held their personal fiefdom, best known as Île-de-France. The fact that the Capetians both held lands as Prince as well as in the title of King gave them a complicated status. Thus they were involved in the struggle for power within France as princes but they also had a religious authority over the Church of France as King. However, and despite the fact that the Capetian kings often treated other princes more as enemies and allies than as subordinates, their royal title was often recognised yet not often respected. The royal authority was so weak in some remote places that bandits were the effective power. { Georges Duby, France in the Middle Ages 987–1460: From Hugh Capet to Joan of Arc (1993), } Some of the king&apos;s vassals would grow so powerful that they would become some of the strongest rulers of western Europe. The Normans, the Plantagenets, the Lusignans, the Hautevilles, the Ramnulfids, and the House of Toulouse successfully carved lands outside of France for themselves. The most important of these conquests for French history was the Norman Conquest of England, following the Battle of Hastings, by William the Conqueror because it linked England to France through Normandy. Although the Normans were now both vassals of the French kings and their equals as Kings of England, their zone of political activity remained centered in France. { David Carpenter The Struggle for Mastery. The Penguin history of Britain 1066–1284 p. 91: &quot; In the first place, after 1072 William was largely an absentee. Of the 170 months remaining of his reign he spent around 130 in France, returning to England only on four occasions. This was no passing phase. Absentee kings continued to spend at best half their time in England until the loss of Normandy in 1204... But this absenteeism solidified rather than sapped royal government since it engendered structures both to maintain peace and extract money on the king&apos;s absence, money which was above all needed across the channel &quot;. } These Norman nobles then commissioned the weaving of the Bayeux Tapestry. An important part of the French aristocracy also involved itself in the crusades, and French knights founded and ruled the Crusader states. An example of the legacy left in the Middle East by these nobles is the Krak des Chevaliers &apos; enlargement by the Counts of Tripoli and Toulouse. [ Rise of the monarchy ] The history of the monarchy is how it overcame the powerful barons over ensuing centuries, and established absolute sovereignty over France in the 16th century. The history of modern France starts with the election Hugh Capet (940-996), the Count of Paris in 987. Hugh&apos;s lands extended little beyond the Paris basin; His political unimportance weighed against the powerful barons who elected him. Many of the king&apos;s vassals (who included for a long time the kings of England) ruled over territories far greater than his own. A number of factors contributed to the rise of the French monarchy. The dynasty established by Hugh Capet continued uninterrupted until 1328. The laws of primogeniture ensured orderly successions of power. Secondly, the successors of Capet came to be recognised as members of an illustrious and ancient royal house and therefore socially superior to their politically and economically superior rivals. Thirdly, the Capetians had the support of the Church which favoured a strong central government in France. This alliance with the Church was one of the great enduring legacies of the Capetians. The First Crusade was composed almost entirely of Frankish Princes. As time went on the power of the King was expanded by conquests, seizures and successful feudal political battles.

Capet was previously &quot; Duke of the Franks &quot; and then became &quot; King of the Franks &quot; (Rex Francorum). He was recorded to be recognised king by the Gauls, Bretons, Danes, Aquitanians, Goths, Spanish and Gascons. Hugh Capet&apos;s reign was marked by the loss of the Spanish marches as they grew more and more independent. Count Borell of Barcelona called for Hugh&apos;s help against Islamic raids, but even if Hugh intended to help Borell, he was otherwise occupied in fighting Charles of Lorraine. The loss of other Spanish principalities then followed. Hugh Capet, the first Capetian king, is not a well documented figure, his greatest achievement being certainly to survive as king and defeating the Carolingian claimant, thus allowing him to establish what would become one of Europe&apos;s most powerful house of kings. { William W. Kibler, ed. Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (1995) } Hugh&apos;s son – Robert the Pious – was crowned King of the Franks before Capet&apos;s demise. Hugh Capet decided so in order to have his succession secured. Robert II, as King of the Franks, met Emperor Henry II in 1023 on the borderline. They agreed to end all claims over each other&apos;s realm, setting a new stage of Capetian and Ottonian relationships. The reign of Robert II was quite important because it involved the Peace and Truce of God and the Cluniac Reforms. Although a king weak in power, Robert II&apos;s efforts were considerable. His surviving charters imply he was heavily relying on the church to rule France, much like his father did. Although he lived with a mistress — Bertha of Burgundy — and was excommunicated because of this, he was regarded as a model of piety for monks (hence his nickname, Robert the Pious). He crowned his son — Hugh Magnus — King of the Franks to secure his succession, however Hugh Magnus rebelled against his father and died fighting him. The next King of the Franks — Henry I — was crowned after Robert&apos;s death, which is quite exceptional for a French king of the times.Henry I was one of the weakest kings of the Franks, and his reign saw the rise of some very powerful nobles such as William the Conqueror. However his biggest source of concerns was his brother — Robert I of Burgundy — who was pushed by his mother to the conflict. Robert of Burgundy was made Duke of Burgundy by King Henry I and had to be satisfied with that title. From Henry I onward the Dukes of Burgundy were relatives of the King of the Franks until the end of the Duchy proper. King Philip I, named by his Kievan mother with a typically Eastern European name, was no more fortunate than his predecessor. { Kibler, ed. Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (1995) } { Godefroy de Bouillon, a French knight, leader of the } { First Crusade and founder of the } { Kingdom of Jerusalem. } It is from Louis VI onward that royal authority became more accepted. Louis VI was more a soldier and warmongering king than a scholar. The way the king raised money from his vassals made him quite unpopular; he was described as greedy and ambitious and that is corroborated by records of the time. His regular attacks on his vassals, although damaging the royal image, reinforced the royal power. From 1127 onward was a skilled politician – Abbot Suger. The abbot was the son of a minor family of knights, but his political advice was extremely valuable to the king. Louis VI successfully defeated, both military and politically, many of the robber baron s. Louis VI frequently summoned his vassals to the court, and those who did not show up often had their land possessions confiscated and military campaigns mounted against them. This drastic policy clearly imposed some royal authority on Paris and its surrounding areas. When Louis VI died in 1137, much progress had been made towards strengthening Capetian authority. Thanks to Abbot Suger&apos;s political advice, King Louis VII enjoyed greater moral authority over France than his predecessors. Even more powerful vassals such as Henry Plantagenet paid homage to the French king. { Capetian France 937–1328 p. 64: Then, in 1151, Henry Plantagenet paid homage for the duchy to Louis VII in Paris, homage he repeated as king of England in 1156. } Abbot Suger arranged the marriage between Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine in Bordeaux which made Louis VII Duke of Aquitaine and gave him considerable power. However, the couple disagreed over the burning of more than a thousand people in Vitry during the conflict against the Count of Champagne. King Louis VII was deeply horrified by the event and sought penitence by going to the holy land. He later involved the Kingdom of France in the Second Crusade but his relationship with Eleanor did not improve. The marriage was ultimately annulled by the pope under the pretext of consanguinity and Eleanor soon married the Duke of Normandy — Henry Fitzempress — who would become King of England as Henry II two years later. Louis VII was once a very powerful monarch and was now facing a much stronger vassal, who was his equal as King of England and his strongest prince as Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine. Abbot Suger&apos;s vision of construction became known as the Gothic Architecture during the later Renaissance. This style became standard for most European cathedrals built in the late middle-age. { Paul Frankl, Gothic Architecture (2001) } [ The late Capetians (1165–1328) ] The late direct Capetian kings were considerably more powerful and influential than the earliest ones. While Philip I could hardly control his Parisian barons, Philip IV could dictate popes and emperors. The late Capetians, although they often ruled for a shorter time than their earlier peers, were often much more influential. This period also saw the rise of a complex system of international alliances and conflicts opposing, through dynasties, Kings of France and England and Holy Roman Emperor. [ Philip II Augustus ] The reign of Philip II Augustus marked an important step in the history of French monarchy. His reign saw the French royal domain and influence greatly expanded. He had set the context for the rise of power to much more powerful monarchs like Saint Louis and Philip the Fair. { Philip II victorious at } { Bouvines thus annexing Normandy and Anjou into his royal domains. This battle involved a complex set of alliances from three important states, the Kingdoms of France and England and the Holy Roman Empire. } Philip II spent an important part of his reign fighting the so-called Angevin Empire, which was probably the greatest threat to the King of France since the rise of the Capetian dynasty. During the first part of his reign Philip II tried using Henry II of England&apos;s son against him. He allied himself with the Duke of Aquitaine and son of Henry II — Richard Lionheart — and together they launched a decisive attack on Henry&apos;s castle and home of Chinon and removed him from power. Richard replaced his father as King of England afterward. The two kings then went crusading during the Third Crusade however their alliance and friendship broke down during the crusade. The two men were once again at odds and fought each other in France and Richard was on the verge of totally defeating Philip II. Adding to their battles in France the Kings of France and England were trying to install their respective allies at the head of the Holy Roman Empire. If Philip II Augustus supported Philip of Swabia, member of the House of Hohenstaufen, Richard Lionheart supported Otto IV, member of the House of Welf. Otto IV had the upper hand and became the Holy Roman Emperor at the expense of Philip of Swabia. The crown of France was saved by Richard&apos;s demise after a wound he received fighting his own vassals in Limousin. John Lackland, Richard&apos;s successor, refused to come to the French court for a trial against the Lusignan s and as Louis VI often did to his rebellious vassals, Philip II confiscated John&apos;s possessions in France. John&apos;s defeat was swift and his attempts to reconquer his French possession at the Battle of Bouvines resulted in complete failure. His allies, most notably Emperor Otto IV, were all defeated or captured and even as King of England he had no means to reconquer Normandy and Anjou. Not only had Philip II annexed Normandy and Anjou, he had captured the Counts of Boulogne and Flanders. Otto IV was overthrown by Frederick II, ally of Philip II of France and a member of the House of Hohenstaufen. The King of France however stopped before conquering Aquitaine and Gascony who remained loyal to the Plantagenet King. In addition to defeating John of England, Philip Augustus founded the Sorbonne and made Paris a city for scholars. Prince Louis (the future Louis VIII) was involved in the subsequent English civil war as French and English (or rather Anglo-Norman) aristocracies were once one and were now split between allegiances. While the French kings were struggling against the Plantagenets, the Church called for the Albigensian Crusade. Southern France was then largely absorbed in the royal domains. [ Saint Louis ] { Saint Louis. He saw France&apos;s cultural expansion in the Western Christian world. } France became a truly centralised kingdom under Louis IX, who initiated several administrative reforms. Saint Louis has often been portrayed as a one dimensional character, a flawless representant of the faith and an administrator caring for the governed ones. However, his reign was far from perfect for everyone; he made unsuccessful crusades and his expanding administrations raised oppositions; he also burned Jewish books at the Pope&apos;s urging. [ Gigot Francis E. Judaism 1910 The Catholic Encyclopedia VIII New York Robert Appleton Company http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm 13 August 2007 ] His judgments were not often practical, although they seemed fair by the standards of the time. It appears Louis had a strong sense of justice and always wanted to judge people himself before applying any sentence. This was said about Louis and French clergy asking for excommunications of Louis&apos; vassals: { Capetian France p. 265. } [ For it would be against God and contrary to right and justice if he compelled any man to seek absolution when the clergy were doing him wrong. ] Louis IX was only twelve years old when he became King of France, his mother — Blanche of Castile — was the effective power although the King was indeed Louis IX. Blanche&apos;s authority was strongly opposed by the French barons yet she could maintain her position as regent (although she did not formally use the title) until Louis was old enough to rule by himself. In 1229 the King had to struggle with a long lasting strike at the University of Paris, the Quartier Latin was strongly hit by these strikes. War was still going on in the County of Toulouse, the royal army was occupied fighting resistance in Languedoc and the kingdom was therefore vulnerable. Count Raymond VII of Toulouse finally signed the Treaty of Paris in 1229, in which he retained much of his lands to life, but his daughter, married to Count Alfonso of Poitou, produced him no heir and so the County of Toulouse went to the King of France. King Henry III of England had not yet recognized the Capetian overlordship over Aquitaine and still hoped to recover Normandy and Anjou and reform the Angevin Empire. He landed in 1230 at Saint-Malo with a massive force. Henry III&apos;s allies in Brittany and Normandy fell down because they did not dare fight their king who led the counterstrike himself. This evolved into the Saintonge War, Henry III was defeated and had to recognise Louis IX&apos;s overlordship although the King of France did not seize Aquitaine from Henry III. Louis IX was now the most important landowner of France, adding to his royal title. There were some opposition to his rule in Normandy, yet it proved remarkably easy to rule, especially compared to the County of Toulouse which had been brutally conquered. The Conseil du Roi, which would evolve into the Parlement, was founded in these times. Saint Louis also supported new forms of art such as Gothic architecture; his Sainte-Chapelle became a very famous gothic building, and he is also credited for the Morgan Bible. After his conflict with King Henry III of England Louis established a cordial relation with the Plantagenet King. An amusing anecdote is about Henry III&apos;s attending the French Parlement, as Duke of Aquitaine, the King of England was always late because he liked to stop each time he met a priest to hear the mass, so Louis made sure no priest was on the way of Henry III. Henry III and Louis IX then started a long contest in who was the most faithful up to the point none ever arrived anymore on time to the Parlement which was then allowed to debate in their absence. { Capetian France p. 264. } The Kingdom was involved in two crusades under Saint Louis: the Seventh Crusade and the Eighth Crusade. Both proved to be complete failures for the French King. He died in the Eighth Crusade and Philip III became king. Philip III took part in another crusading disaster: the Aragonese Crusade, which cost him his life. More administrative reforms were made by Philip the Fair. This king was responsible for the end of the Templars, signed the Auld Alliance, and established the Parlement of Paris. Philip IV was so powerful that he could name popes and emperors, unlike the early Capetians. The papacy was moved to Avignon and all the contemporary popes were French such as Philip IV&apos;s puppet: Bertrand de Goth.

This was also the time of the Black Death, as well as several civil wars. The French population suffered much from these wars. In 1420 by the Treaty of Troyes Henry V was made heir to Charles VI. Henry V failed to outlive Charles so it was Henry VI of England and France who consolidated the Dual-Monarchy of England and France. It has been argued that the difficult conditions the French population suffered during the Hundred Years&apos; War awakened French nationalism, a nationalism represented by Joan of Arc. Although this is debatable, the Hundred Years&apos; War is remembered more as a Franco-English war than as a succession of feudal struggles. During this war, France evolved politically and militarily. Although a Franco-Scottish army was successful at Baugé, the humiliating defeats of Poitiers and Agincourt forced the French nobility to realise they could not stand just as armoured knights without an organised army. Charles VII established the first French standing army, the Compagnies d&apos;ordonnance, and defeated the Plantagenets once at Patay and again, using cannons, at Formigny. The Battle of Castillon was regarded as the last engagement of this &quot; war &quot;, yet Calais and the Channel Islands remained ruled by the Plantagenets.

[ Early Modern France (1453–1789) ] [ Early Modern France ] { Charles the Bold, the last Valois } { Duke of Burgundy, died at the } { Battle of Nancy. His death marked the division of his lands between the Kings of France and Habsburg Dynasty. } The Duke of Burgundy had assembled a large territory including his native duchy and the Burgundian Netherlands. King Louis XI faced Charles the Bold during Burgundian Wars and the French King was allied with the Old Swiss Confederacy. The Duke of Burgundy was defeated at Morat, Battle of Grandson, Héricourt and ultimately defeated at Nancy in 1477. The Duchy of Burgundy was annexed by France but the part of Burgundy that formed Franche-Comté was given to Philip I of Castile in 1493. From 1487 to 1491, France attacked and defeated Brittany, an independent duchy.In 1532, Brittany was incorporated into the Kingdom of France. [ Estates ] Political power was widely dispersed. The Catholic Church controlled about 40% of the wealth, tied up in long-term endowments that could be added to but not reduced. The king (not the pope) nominated bishops, but typically had to negotiate with noble families that had close ties to local monasteries and church establishments. The nobility came second in terms of wealth, but there was no unity as each noble had his own lands, his network of regional connections, and his own military force. The cities had a quasi-independent status, and were largely controlled by the leading merchants and guilds. Paris was by far the largest city with 220,000 people in 1547 and a history of steady growth. Lyons and Rouen each had about 40,000 population, but Lyon had a powerful banking community and a vibrant culture. Bordeaux was next with only 20,000 population in 1500. About 97% of France&apos;s 13 million people (in 1484) lived in rural villages. In many cases the peasants had well-established rights that the authorities had to respect. In terms of political power the law courts ( &quot; Parlements &quot; ) were powerful, especially that of France. The king had bout 10,000 officials in royal service—very few indeed for such a large country, and with very slow internal communications over an inadequate road system. (Travel was usually faster by ocean ship or river boat.) The different estates occasionally met together in the &quot; Estates General &quot;, but in practice it had no power, for it could petition the king but could not pass laws. The sense of &quot; being French &quot; was uncommon in 1500, as people clung to their local identities. By 1600, however, people were starting to call themselves &quot; bon françois. &quot; { Frederick J. Baumgartner, France in the Sixteenth Century (1995) pp 4-7 } [ Rural society ] In the 17th century peasants had ties to the market economy, provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village (or town). Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The &quot; stable &quot; core of French society, town guildspeople and village labourers, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal. Accepting the existence of these two societies, the constant tension between them, and extensive geographic and social mobility tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the social structure, economy, and even political system of early modern France. Collins (1991) argues that the Annales School paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy; and grossly exaggerated social stability. { James B. Collins, &quot; Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-modern France. &quot; Journal of Social History 1991 24(3): 563-577. Issn: 0022-4529 Fulltext: } { Ebsco. For the Annales interpretation see Pierre Goubert, The French Peasantry in the Seventeenth Century (1986) excerpt and text search } [ Wars ] France engaged in the long Italian Wars (1494–1559), which marked the beginning of early modern France. Francis I faced powerful foes, and he was captured at Pavia. The French monarchy then sought for allies and found one in the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Admiral Barbarossa captured Nice on 5 August 1543 and handed it down to Francis I. Around this same time, the Protestant Reformation, led in France mainly by John Calvin, was challenging the power of the Catholic Church in France. During the 16th century, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs were the dominant power in Europe. In addition to Spain and Austria, they controlled a number of kingdoms and duchies across Europe. Charles Quint, under the titles of Count of Burgundy, Holy Roman Emperor, and King of Aragon, Castile and Germany, among others, encircled France. The Spanish Tercio was used with great success against French knights. Finally, on 7 January 1558, the Duke of Guise seized Calais from the English. [ Language ] [ History of French ] Although most peasants in France spoke local dialects, an official language emerged in Paris and the French language became the preferred language of Europe&apos;s aristocracy. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (born in 1500) quipped, &quot; I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse. &quot; [ http://books.google.com/books?id%3DtCobBRiv3_MC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA299 299 The letters of George Santayana: 1948–1952, Book 8 George Santayana, William G. Holzberger MIT Press, 2008 0-262-19571-2 31  July2008 ] Because of its international status, there was a desire to regulate the French language. Several reforms of the French language worked to make it more uniform. The Renaissance writer François Rabelais (b. 1494) helped to shape French as a literary language, Rabelais&apos; French is characterised by the re-introduction of Greek and Latin words. Jacques Peletier du Mans (born 1517) was one of the scholars who reformed the French language. He improved Nicolas Chuquet &apos;s long scale system by adding names for intermediate numbers ( &quot; milliards &quot; instead of &quot; thousand million &quot;, etc.). [ Colonies ] [ French colonial empire ] During the 16th century, the king established colonies and began to claim and settle North American territories. { Christopher Hodson and Brett Rushforth, &quot; Absolutely Atlantic: Colonialism and the Early Modern French State in Recent Historiography, &quot; History Compass, (Jan 2010) 8#1 pp 101-117, } Jacques Cartier was one of the great explorers who ventured deep into American territories during the 16th century. The largest settlement was New France, with the towns of Quebec City and Montreal with settlement commencing in the early 17th century with the voyages of Samuel de Champlain. { Allan Greer, &quot; National, Transnational, and Hypernational Historiographies: New France Meets Early American History, &quot; Canadian Historical Review, (2010) 91#4 pp 695-724, in Project MUSE } [ Huguenots ] [ French Wars of Religion ] { Henry IV of France, King of } { France and } { Navarre, was the first French } { Bourbon king. } Renewed Catholic reaction headed by the powerful duke of Guise, led to a massacre of Huguenots at Vassy in 1562, starting the first of the French Wars of Religion, during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and Catholic forces. In the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew&apos;s Day massacre of 1572. The Wars of Religion culminated in the War of the Three Henrys in which Henry III assassinated Henry de Guise, leader of the Spanish-backed Catholic league, and the king was murdered in return. Following this war Henry III of Navarre became king of France as Henry IV and enforced the Edict of Nantes (1598). { Mack P. Holt, The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629 (2nd ed. 2005 } French Protestantism, which was largely Calvinist derived its support from the lesser nobles and trading classes. Its two main strongholds were south west France and Normandy, but even in these districts the Catholics were a majority. Protestantism in France was considered a grave threat to national unity, as the Huguenot minority felt a closer affinity with German and Dutch Calvinists than with their fellow Frenchmen. In an effort to cement their position they often allied with French enemies. The animosity between the two sides led to the French Wars of Religion and the St. Bartholomew&apos;s Day Massacre. The religious wars ended in 1593, when the Huguenot Henry of Navarre (1553-1610), who was already effectively king of France became a Catholic and was recognised by both Catholics and Protestants as King Henry IV (reigned 1589-1610). The main provisions of the Edict of Nantes (1598), which Henry IV had issued as a charter of religious freedoms for the Huguenots, were as follows; a) Huguenots were allowed to hold religious services in certain towns in each province; b) They were allowed to control and fortify eight cities (including La Rochelle and Montauban ); c) Special courts were established to try Huguenot offenders; d)Huguenots were to have equal civil rights with the Catholics. The military privileges were incorporated in the Edict in order to allay the fears of the minority. Over time it became clear these privileges would be open to abuse and when in 1620 the Huguenots proclaimed a constitution for the &apos;Republic of the Reformed Churches of France&apos;, the Prime Minister Cardinal Richelieu (1585–1642) invoked the entire powers of the state. Religious conflicts therefore resumed under Louis XIII when Richelieu forced Protestants to disarm their army and fortresses. This conflict ended in the Siege of La Rochelle (1627–1628), in which Protestants and their English supporters were defeated. The following Peace of Alais confirmed religious freedom yet dismantled the Protestant defences. { Mack P. Holt, The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629 (2nd ed. 2005 } In the face of persecution, Huguenots dispersed widely throughout Protestant kingdoms in Europe and America. { Randy J. Sparks and Bertrand Van Ruymbeke, Memory and Identity: The Huguenots in France and the Atlantic Diaspora (2008) } [ Thirty Years war ] [ Thirty Years War ] The religious conflicts that plagued France also ravaged the Habsburg-led Holy Roman Empire. The Thirty Years War eroded the power of the Catholic Habsburgs. Although Cardinal Richelieu, the powerful chief minister of France, had previously mauled the Protestants, he joined this war on their side in 1636 because it was the raison d&apos;état. Imperial Habsburg forces invaded France, ravaged Champagne, and nearly threatened Paris. Richelieu died in 1642 and was succeeded by Cardinal Mazarin, while Louis XIII died one year later and was succeeded by Louis XIV. France was served by some very efficient commanders such as Louis II de Bourbon (Condé) and Henry de la Tour d&apos;Auvergne (Turenne). The French forces won a decisive victory at Rocroi (1643), and the Spanish army was decimated; the Tercio was broken. The Truce of Ulm (1647) and the Peace of Westphalia (1648) brought an end to the war. But some challenges remained. France was hit by civil unrest known as the Fronde which in turn evolved into the Franco-Spanish War in 1653. Louis II de Bourbon joined the Spanish army this time, but suffered a severe defeat at Dunkirk (1658) by Henry de la Tour d&apos;Auvergne. The terms for the peace inflicted upon the Spanish kingdoms in the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) were harsh, as France annexed Northern Catalonia. { Peter H. Wilson, Europe’s Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years War (2009) } Amidst this turmoil, René Descartes sought answers to philosophical questions through the use of logic and reason and formulated what would be called Cartesian Dualism in 1641. [ Louis XIV ] [ Louis XIV ] { Louis XIV, the &quot; Sun King &quot; } Louis XIV, known as the &quot; Sun King &quot;, wanted to be remembered as a patron of the arts, like his ancestor Louis IX. He invited Jean-Baptiste Lully to establish the French opera. A tumultuous friendship was established between Lully and Molière. Jules Hardouin Mansart became France&apos;s most important architect of the period. Louis XIV&apos;s long reign saw France involved in many wars that drained its treasury. His reign began during the Thirty Years&apos; War and during the Franco-Spanish war. His military architect, Vauban, became famous for his pentagonal fortresses, and Jean-Baptiste Colbert supported the royal spending as much as possible. French dominated League of the Rhine fought against the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Saint Gotthard in 1664. The battle was won by the Christians, chiefly through the brave attack of 6,000 French troops led by La Feuillade and Coligny. { Count Miklós Zrínyi,the Poet-Warlord } France fought the War of Devolution against Spain in 1667. France&apos;s defeat of Spain and invasion of the Spanish Netherlands alarmed England and Sweden. With the Dutch Republic they formed the Triple Alliance to check Louis XIV&apos;s expansion. Louis II de Bourbon had captured Franche-Comté, but in face of an indefensible position, Louis XIV agreed to a peace at Aachen. Under its terms, Louis XIV did not annex Franche-Comté but did gain Lille. { John B. Wolf, Louis XIV (1968), the standard scholarly biography online edition } Peace was fragile, and war broke out again between France and the Dutch Republic in the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678). Louis XIV asked for the Dutch Republic to resume war against the Spanish Netherlands, but the republic refused. France attacked the Dutch Republic and was joined by England in this conflict. Through targeted inundations of polder s by breaking dykes, the French invasion of the Dutch Republic was brought to a halt. The Dutch Admiral Michiel de Ruyter inflicted a few strategic defeats on the Anglo-French naval alliance and forced England to retire from the war in 1674. Because the Netherlands could not resist indefinitely, it agreed to peace in the Treaties of Nijmegen, according to which France would annex France-Comté and acquire further concessions in the Spanish Netherlands. On 6 May 1682, the royal court moved to the Palace of Versailles, which Louis XIV had greatly expanded. Peace did not last, and war between France and Spain again resumed. The War of the Reunions broke out (1683–1684), and again Spain, with its ally the Holy Roman Empire, was easily defeated. Meanwhile, in October 1685 Louis signed the Edict of Fontainebleau ordering the destruction of all Protestant churches and schools in France. Its immediate consequence was a large Protestant exodus from France. The two massive famine s struck France between 1693 and 1710, killing over two million people. [ Ó Gráda Cormac Chevet, Jean-Michel 2002 Famine And Market In Ancient RégimeFrance The Journal of Economic History 62 706–733 10.1017/S0022050702001055 17494233 3 ] France would soon be involved in another war, the War of the Grand Alliance. This time the theatre was not only in Europe but also in North America. Although the war was long and difficult (it was also called the Nine Years War), its results were inconclusive. The Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 confirmed French sovereignty over Alsace, yet rejected its claims to Luxembourg. Louis also had to evacuate Catalonia and the Palatinate. This peace was considered a truce by all sides, thus war was to start again. In 1701 the War of the Spanish Succession began. The Bourbon Philip of Anjou was designated heir to the throne of Spain. The Habsburg Emperor Leopold opposed a Bourbon succession, because the power that such a succession would bring to the Bourbon rulers of France would disturb the delicate balance of power in Europe. Therefore, he claimed the Spanish thrones for himself. England and the Dutch Republic joined Leopold against Louis XIV and Philip of Anjou. The allied forces were led by John Churchill and by Prince Eugene of Savoy. They inflicted a few resounding defeats to the French army; the Battle of Blenheim in 1704 was the first major land battle lost by France since its victory at Rocroi in 1643. Yet, after the extremely bloody battles of Ramillies and Malplaquet, Pyrrhic victories for the allies, they had lost too many men to continue the war. Led by Villars, the French forces recovered much of the lost ground in battles such as Denain. Finally, a compromise was achieved with the Ultrecht in 1713. Philip of Anjou was confirmed as Philip V, king of Spain, and Emperor Leopold did not get the throne, but Philip V was barred from inheriting France. { Wolf, Louis XIV (1968) } [ Ancien Régime ] [ Ancien Régime in France ] France in the Ancien Régime covered a territory of around [ 200000 sqmi km2 ], and supported 20 million people in 1700. At least 80% of the population were peasants. France had the second largest population in Europe around 1700. Britain had five or six million, Spain had eight million, and the Austrian Habsburgs had around eight million. Russia was the most populated European country at the time. France&apos;s lead slowly faded after 1700, as other countries grew faster. { Pierre Goubert, The Ancien Regime (1973) pp. 2-9. } The population was predominantly rural. In the 17th century rich peasants who had ties to the market economy provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village (or town). Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The &quot; stable &quot; core of French society, town guildspeople and village laboureurs, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal. Accepting the existence of these two societies, the constant tension between them, and extensive geographic and social mobility tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the social structure, economy, and even political system of early modern France. Collins (1991) argues that the Annales School paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy; and grossly exaggerated social stability. { James B. Collins, &quot; Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-Modern France, &quot; Journal of Social History (1991) 24#3 pp 563-577 in JSTOR For the Annales interpretation see Pierre Goubert, The French Peasantry in the Seventeenth Century (1986) excerpt and text search } [ Wars ] [ Seven Years&apos; War ] [ French Renaissance French colonization of the Americas Age of Enlightenment ] Louis XIV died in 1715 and was succeeded by his five-year-old great grandson who reigned as Louis XV until his death in 1774. In 1718, France was once again at war, as Philip II of Orléans &apos;s regency joined the War of the Quadruple Alliance against Spain. King Philip V of Spain had to withdraw from the conflict confronted with the reality that Spain was no longer a great power of Europe. Under Cardinal Fleury &apos;s administration, peace was maintained as long as possible. However, in 1733 another war broke in central Europe, this time about the Polish succession, and France joined the war against the Austrian Empire. This time there was no invasion of the Netherlands, and Britain remained neutral. As a consequence, Austria was left alone against a Franco-Spanish alliance and faced a military disaster. Peace was settled in the Treaty of Vienna (1738), according to which France would annex, through inheritance, the Duchy of Lorraine. { Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, The Ancien Regime: A History of France 1610–1774 (1999) } Two years later, in 1740, war broke out over the Austrian succession, and France seized the opportunity to join the conflict. The war played out in North America and India as well as Europe, and inconclusive terms were agreed to in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748). Once again, no one regarded this as a peace, but rather as a mere truce. Prussia was then becoming a new threat, as it had gained substantial territory from Austria. This led to the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, in which the alliances seen during the previous war were mostly inverted. France was now allied to Austria and Russia while Britain was now allied to Prussia. In the North American theatre, France was allied with various Native American peoples during the Seven Years&apos; War and, despite a temporary success at the battles of the Great Meadows and Monongahela, French forces were defeated at the disastrous Battle of the Plains of Abraham in Quebec. In Europe, repeated French attempts to overwhelm Hanover failed. In 1762 Russia, France and Austria were on the verge of crushing Prussia, when the Anglo-Prussian Alliance was saved by the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg. At sea naval defeats against British fleets at Lagos and Quiberon Bay in 1759 and a crippling blockade forced France to keep its ships in port. Finally peace was concluded in the Treaty of Paris (1763), and France lost its North American empire. { Daniel Marston, The Seven Years&apos; War (2001) } Britain&apos;s success had allowed them to eclipse France as the leading colonial power. France sought revenge for this defeat, and under Choiseul France started to rebuild. In 1766 the French Kingdom annexed Lorraine and the following year bought Corsica from Genoa. { Lord Cornwallis surrenders at } { Yorktown to American and French allies. } Having lost its colonial empire, France saw a good opportunity for revenge against Britain in signing an alliance with the Americans in 1778, and sending an army and navy that turned the American Revolution into a world war. Spain, allied to France by the Family Compact, and the Dutch Republic also joined the war on the French side. Admiral de Grasse defeated a British fleet at Chesapeake Bay while Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau and Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette joined American forces in defeating the British at Yorktown. The war was concluded by the Treaty of Paris (1783), under which Britain lost its former American colonies. Despite this the war had largely been a disappointment for France, it had been extremely expensive and they had only received Tobago for their efforts. { Jonathan R. Dull, A Diplomatic History of American Revolution (1985) } While the state expanded, new ideas broke on the role of the king and the powers of the state. Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu described the separation of powers. Many other French philosophers and intellectuals gained social, political and philosophical influence on a global scale, including Voltaire, Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose essay The Social Contract, Or Principles of Political Right was a catalyst for governmental and societal reform throughout Europe. Science, mathematics and technology also flourished. French scientists such as Antoine Lavoisier worked to replace the archaic units of weights and measures by a coherent scientific system, commissioned by king Louis XVI. Lavoisier also formulated the law of Conservation of mass and discovered oxygen and hydrogen. { Daniel Roche, France in the Enlightenment (1998) ch 15 } The Early Modern period in French history spans the following reigns, from 1461 to the Revolution, breaking in 1789: Louis XI the Prudent Charles VIII the Affable Louis XII Francis I Henry II and Catherine de&apos; Medici Francis II Charles IX Henry III { House of Bourbon } Henry IV the Great the Regency of Marie de Medici Louis XIII the Just and his minister Cardinal Richelieu the Regency of Anne of Austria and her minister Cardinal Mazarin Louis XIV the Sun King and his minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert the Régence of Philip II of Orléans Louis XV the Beloved and his minister Cardinal André-Hercule de Fleury Louis XVI [ Enlightenment ] [ Age of Enlightenment ] 250px The &quot; Philosophes &quot; were eighteenth century French intellectuals who dominated the French Enlightenment and were influential across Europe. Their interests were diverse, with experts in scientific, literary, philosophical and sociological matters. The ultimate goal of the philosophes was human progress; by concentrating on social and material sciences, they believed that a rational society was the only logical outcome of a freethinking and reasoned populace. They also advocated Deism and religious tolerance. Many believed religion had been used as a source of conflict since time eternal, and that logical, rational thought was the way forward for mankind. { Peter Hanns Reill and Ellen Judy Wilson, Encyclopædia of the Enlightenment(2nd ed. 2004) } The philosophe Denis Diderot was Editor in Chief of the famous Enlightenment accomplishment, the 72,000 article Encyclopédie (1751-1772). It sparked a revolution in learning throughout the enlightened world. { Arthur Wilson, Diderot, the Appeal to Posterity, 1759-1784 (1972) } In the early part of the 18th century the movement was dominated by Voltaire and Montesquieu, but the movement grew in momentum as the century moved on. Overall the Philosophes were inspired by the thoughts of René Descartes, the skepticism of the Libertins and the popularisation of science by Bernard de Fontenelle. Sectarian dissensions within the church, the gradual weakening of the absolute monarch and the numerous wars of Louis XIV allowed their influence to spread. Between 1748-1751 the Philosophes reached their most influential period, as Montesquieu published Spirit of Laws (1748) and Jean Jacques Rousseau published Discourse on the Moral Effects of the Arts and Sciences (1750). The representative leaders of the French Enlightenment--a writer of enormous influence across Europe--was Voltaire (1694-1778). His many books included poems and plays, works of satire ( Candide [1759]) and books on history, science and philosophy, including numerous (anonymous) contributions to the Encyclopédie, and an extensive correspondence. A witty, tireless antagonist to the alliance between the French state and the church, he was exiled from France on a number of occasions. In exile in England he came to appreciate British thought and he popularized Isaac Newton in Europe. { Nicholas Cronk, ed. The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire (2009) } [ Revolution and Napoleon (1789–1815) ] [ The Revolution ] [ French Revolution ] { Storming of the Bastille, 14 July 1789 } The immediate trigger for the Revolution was Louis XVI&apos;s attempts to solve the government&apos;s worsening financial situation. In February 1787 his finance minister, Charles Alexandre de Calonne, convened an Assembly of Notables, a group of nobles, clergy, bourgeoisie, and bureaucrats selected in order to bypass the local parliaments. This group was asked to approve a new land tax that would, for the first time, include a tax on the property of nobles and clergy. The assembly did not approve the tax, instead demanding that Louis XVI call the Estates-General. In August 1788 the King agreed to convene the Estates-General in May 1789. While the Third Estate demanded and was granted &quot; double representation &quot; so as to balance the First and Second Estate, voting was to occur &quot; by orders &quot; – votes of the Third Estate were to be weighted – effectively canceling double representation. This eventually led to the Third Estate breaking away from the Estates-General and, joined by members of the other estates, proclaiming the creation of the National Assembly, an assembly not of the Estates but of &quot; the People. &quot; In an attempt to keep control of the process and prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des États where the Assembly met. After finding the door to their chamber locked and guarded, the Assembly met nearby on a tennis court and pledged the Tennis Court Oath on 20 June 1789, binding them &quot; never to separate, and to meet wherever circumstances demand, until the constitution of the kingdom is established and affirmed on solid foundations. &quot; They were joined by some sympathetic members of the Second and First estates. After the king fired his finance minister, Jacques Necker, for giving his support and guidance to the Third Estate, worries surfaced that the legitimacy of the newly formed National Assembly might be threatened by royalists. Paris was soon consumed with riots, anarchy, and widespread looting. Because the royal leadership essentially abandoned the city, the mobs soon had the support of the French Guard, including arms and trained soldiers. On 14 July 1789, the insurgents set their eyes on the large weapons and ammunition cache inside the Bastille fortress, which also served as a symbol of royal tyranny. Insurgents seized the Bastille prison, killing the governor and several of his guards. The French now celebrate 14 July each year as a symbol of the shift away from the Ancien Regime to a more modern, democratic state. Gilbert du Motier, a hero of the War of American Independence, took command of the National Guard, and the king was forced to recognize the Tricolour Cockade. Although peace was made, several nobles did not regard the new order as acceptable and emigrated in order to push the neighboring, aristocratic kingdoms to war against the new democratic regime. Because of this new period of instability, the state was struck for several weeks in July and August 1789 by the Great Fear, a period of violent class conflict. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen was adopted by the National Assembly in August 1789 as a first step in their effort to write a constitution. Considered to be a precursor to modern international rights instruments and using the U.S. Declaration of Independence as a model, it defined a set of individual rights and collective rights of all of the estates as one. Influenced by the doctrine of natural rights, these rights were deemed universal and valid in all times and places, pertaining to human nature itself. The Assembly also replaced France&apos;s historic provinces with eighty-three departments, uniformly administered and approximately equal to one another in extent and population. On 4 August 1789, the Assembly abolished feudalism, in what became known as the August Decrees, sweeping away both the seigneurial rights of the Second Estate and the tithes gathered by the First Estate. In the course of a few hours, nobles, clergy, towns, provinces, companies, and cities lost their special privileges. The Assembly abolished the symbolic paraphernalia of the Ancien Régime, armorial bearings, liveries, etc., which alienated the more conservative nobles. Amidst these intrigues, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organization made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself. Jury trials started for criminal cases. The King would have the unique power to propose war, with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war. The Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers and suppressed guilds, masterships, and workers&apos; organizations. Consequently, an individual could only gain the right to practice a trade through the purchase of a license and worker strikes became illegal. The Revolution brought about a massive shifting of powers from the Roman Catholic Church to the state. Under the Ancien Régime, the Church had been the largest landowner in the country. Legislation enacted in 1790 abolished the Church&apos;s authority to levy a tax on crops, cancelled special privileges for the clergy, and confiscated Church property. The Assembly essentially addressed the financial crisis in part by having the nation take over the property of the Church. The republican government also enforced the Système International d&apos;Unités, commissioned by Louis XVI, which became known as the Metric System. Charles-Augustin de Coulomb and André-Marie Ampère &apos;s works on electricity and electromagnetism were also recognised, and their units are integrated into the Metric System. When a mob from Paris attacked the royal palace at Versailles in October 1789 seeking redress for their severe poverty, the royal family was forced to move to the Tuileries Palace in Paris. Later in June 1791, the royal family secretly fled Paris in disguise for Varennes near France&apos;s northeastern border in order to seek royalist support the king believed he could trust, but they were soon discovered en route. They were brought back to Paris, after which they were essentially kept under house-arrest at the Tuileries. Factions within the Assembly began to clarify. The opposition to revolution sat on the right-hand side of the Assembly. The &quot; Royalist democrats &quot; or monarchiens inclined toward organizing France along lines similar to the British constitutional model. The &quot; National Party &quot;, representing the centre or centre-left of the assembly represented somewhat more extreme views. The increasingly middle-class National Guard under Lafayette also slowly emerged as a power in its own right. With most of the Assembly still favoring a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic, the various groupings reached a compromise that left Louis XVI little more than a figurehead. He had perforce to swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to de facto abdication. Under the Constitution of 1791, France would function as a constitutional monarchy. The King had to share power with the elected Legislative Assembly, but he still retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers. The Legislative Assembly first met on 1 October 1791 and degenerated into chaos less than a year later. The Legislative Assembly consisted of about 165 Feuillants (constitutional monarchists) on the right, about 330 Girondists (liberal republicans) in the center, a vocal group of Jacobins (radical revolutionaries) on the left, and about 250 deputies unaffiliated with any of those factions. Early on, the King vetoed legislation that threatened the émigrés with death and that decreed that every non-juring clergyman must take within eight days the civic oath mandated by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Over the course of a year, disagreements like this would result in a constitutional crisis, leading the Revolution to higher levels. On the foreign affairs front, in the Declaration of Pillnitz of August 1791 Emperor Leopold II, Count Charles of Artois and King William II of Prussia made Louis XVI&apos;s cause their own. These noblemen also required the Assembly to be dissolved through threats of war, but, instead of cowing the French, it infuriated them. The borders were militarised as a consequence. Under the Constitution of 1791, the solution of a constitutional monarchy was adopted, and the king supported a war against Austria in order to increase his popularity, starting the long French Revolutionary Wars. On the night of the 10 August, the Jacobins, who had mainly opposed the war, suspended the monarchy. With the Prussian army entering France, more doubts were raised against the aristocracy, and these tensions climaxed during the September Massacres. After the first great victory of the French revolutionary troops at the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792, the French First Republic was proclaimed the next day, on 21 September 1792. The new French Republican Calendar was then legally enforced. The Mountain is the English translation for the French word, Montagne, which was the radical political faction of the National Convention who considered themselves the true patriots of the French Revolution. { Andress, David. The Terror. p. 118 } Customarily, its members, called Montagnards, sat on the highest tiered benches in the Convention hall, therefore giving the party its name. An alternate meaning of the name, one more metaphorical, implied that mountains are a natural, pure landscape preferred to the corruption of the city, which was represented by its opposing faction, the Girondins. { Andress, David. The Terror. p. 131 } The Mountain had 302 members during its reign in 1793 and 1794, including committee members and deputies who voted with the faction. { Patrick, Alison. &quot; Political Divisions in the French National Convention 1792–93 &quot; p. 436 } Most of its members came from the middle class and tended to represent the Parisian population. { Palmer, R.R. Twelve Who Ruled. p. 26 } Its leaders included Maximilien Robespierre, Jean-Paul Marat, and Georges Danton. { Palmer, R.R. Twelve Who Ruled. p. 25 } This party eventually gained overwhelming power in the Convention and governed France during the Reign of Terror. The Montagnards and the Girondins were both originally Jacobins, a political club which was founded according to republican beliefs and whose members wanted a French democratic republic. [ Jack Richard Censer Lynn Avery Hunt Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution http://books.google.com/books?id%3DOSDNl6Ydq_oC 2001 Penn State U.P. 64 ] The Jacobin Club, however, encountered political tension beginning in 1791 due to conflicting viewpoints in response to several revolutionary events and how to best achieve a democratic republic. { David Andress, The Terror p. 381 } As a result, two factions emerged: the Girondins and the Montagnards. The latter sided with the Parisian militants, also known as the sans-culottes, who aimed for a more repressive form of government that would institute a price maximum on essential consumer goods and would punish all traitors and enemies of the Republic. { Censer, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity pp. 64,74 } Additionally, between war and political differences, the Montagnards believed these crises required emergency solutions. { Hugh Gough, The Terror in the French Revolution p. 31 } Possibly the two most significant factors in the quarrel and consequential split between the Montagnards and the Girondins include the Trial of King Louis XVI and the September Massacres. The official fall of the monarchy came on 10 August 1792 after Louis XVI refused to rescind his veto of the constitution of the National Assembly. The Mountain argued for immediate execution of the king by military court-martial, insisting that he was undermining the Revolution. Because a trial would require the &quot; presumption of innocence, &quot; such a proceeding would contradict the mission of the National Convention. The Girondins, in contrast, agreed that the king was guilty of treason but argued for his clemency and favored the option of exile or popular referendum as his sentence. { Censer, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, pp. 64–66 } However, the trial progressed and Louis XVI was executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793. The second key factor in the split between the Montagnards and the Girondins was the September Massacres of 1792. Radical Parisians, members of the National Guard, and fédérés were angry with the poor progress in the war against Austria and Prussia and the forced enlistment of 30,000 volunteers. On 10 August, radicals went on a killing spree, slaughtering roughly 1,300 inmates in various Paris prisons, many of whom were simply common criminals, not the treasonous counterrevolutionaries condemned by the Mountain. { Patrice Higonnet, Goodness Beyond Virtue p. 37 } The Girondins did not tolerate the massacres, but neither the Montagnards of the Legislative Assembly nor the Paris Commune took any action to stop or condemn the killings. Members of the Girondins later accused Marat, Robespierre, and Danton as inciters of the massacres in an attempt to further their dictatorial power. { Paul R. Hanson, The Jacobin Republic Under Fire p. 40-41 } Members of the Mountain went on to establish the Committee of Public Safety under Robespierre, which would be responsible for the Terror, the bloodiest and one of the most controversial phases of the French Revolution. The time between 1792 and 1794 was dominated by the ideology of the Mountain until the execution of Robespierre on 28 July 1794. { Louis XV, had stood. } When the Brunswick Manifesto of July 1792 once more threatened the French population with Austrian (Imperial) and Prussian attacks, Louis XVI was suspected of treason and taken along with his family from the Tuileries Palace in August 1792 by insurgents supported by a new revolutionary Paris Commune. The King and Queen ended up prisoners, and a rump session of the Legislative Assembly suspended the monarchy. Little more than a third of the deputies were present, almost all of them Jacobins. The King was later tried and convicted and, on 21 January 1793, was executed by the guillotine. Marie Antoinette, would follow him to the guillotine on 16 October. What remained of a national government depended on the support of the insurrectionary Commune. When the Commune sent gangs into prisons to arbitrarily adjudicate and butcher 1400 victims, and then addressed a circular letter to the other cities of France, inviting them to follow this example, the Assembly could offer only feeble resistance. This situation persisted until a National Convention, charged with writing a new constitution, met on 20 September 1792 and became the new de facto government of France. The next day it abolished the monarchy and declared a republic. When the war went badly, prices rose, and the sans-culottes (poor labourers and radical Jacobins) rioted, counter-revolutionary activities began in some regions. This encouraged the Jacobins to seize power through a parliamentary coup, backed up by force effected by mobilising public support against the Girondist faction, and by utilising the mob power of the Parisian sans-culottes. An alliance of Jacobin and sans-culottes elements thus became the effective centre of the new government. Policy became considerably more radical. In September 1793 a period known as the Reign of Terror ensued for approximately 12 months. The Committee of Public Safety, set up by the National Convention on 6 April 1793, formed the de facto executive government of France. Under war conditions and with national survival seemingly at stake, the Jacobins under Maximilien Robespierre centralized denunciations, trials, and executions under the supervision of this committee of twelve members. At least 18,000 people met their deaths under the guillotine or otherwise, after accusations of counter-revolutionary activities. In 1794, Robespierre had ultra-radicals and moderate Jacobins executed. As a consequence of these actions, however, Robespierre&apos;s own popular support eroded markedly. On 27 July 1794, the Thermidorian Reaction led to the arrest and execution of Robespierre. The new government was predominantly made up of Girondists who had survived the Terror and, after taking power, they took revenge as well by banning the Jacobin Club and executing many of its former members in what was known as the White Terror. After the stated aim of the National Convention to export revolution, the guillotining of Louis XVI of France, and the French opening of the Scheldt, a military coalition was formed and set up against France. Spain, Naples, Great Britain and the Netherlands joined Austria and Prussia in The First Coalition (1792–1797), the first major concerted effort of multiple European powers to contain Revolutionary France. It took shape after the wars had already begun. The Republican government in Paris was radicalised after a diplomatic coup from the Jacobins and said it would be the Guerre Totale and called for a Levée en masse. Royalist invasion forces were defeated at Toulon in 1793, leaving the French republican forces in an offensive position and granting a young officer, Napoleon Bonaparte, a certain fame. Following their victory at Fleurus, the Republicans occupied Belgium and the Rhineland. An invasion of the Netherlands established the puppet Batavian Republic. Finally, a peace agreement was concluded between France, Spain and Prussia in 1795 at Basel. The Convention approved a new &quot; Constitution of the Year III &quot; on 17 August 1795; it was ratified by a national plebiscite and took effect on 26 September 1795. [ Gregory Fremont-Barnes Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815 http://books.google.com/books?id%3D6_2wkP4j-EsC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA159 2007 Greenwood Publishing Group 159 ] The new constitution created the Directory and the first bicameral legislature in French history. The parliament consisted of 500 representatives – le Conseil des Cinq-Cents (the Council of the Five Hundred) – and 250 senators – le Conseil des Anciens (the Council of Elders). Executive power went to five &quot; directors &quot;, named annually by the Conseil des Anciens from a list submitted by le Conseil des Cinq-Cents. The nation desired rest and the healing of its many wounds. Those who wished to restore Louis XVIII and the Ancien Régime and those who would have renewed the Reign of Terror were insignificant in number. The possibility of foreign interference had vanished with the failure of the First Coalition. Nevertheless, the four years of the Directory were a time of arbitrary government and chronic disquiet. The late atrocities had made confidence or goodwill between the parties impossible. As the majority of French people wanted to be rid of them, they could achieve their purpose only by extraordinary means. The Convention habitually disregarded the terms of the constitution, and, when the elections went against them, appealed to the sword. They resolved to prolong the war as the best expedient for prolonging their power. They were thus driven to rely upon the armies, which also desired war and were becoming increasingly less civic in temper. The Directory lasted until 1799 when Napoleon staged a coup and installed the Consulate. The Consulate still operated within the First Republic, was replaced by the First Empire, established by Napoleon in 1804. [ David Nicholls Napoleon: A Biographical Companion http://books.google.com/books?id%3DPmCdv91zPS0C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA81 1999 ABC-CLIO 81 ] [ The Napoleonic Era ] [ Napoleonic wars ] { Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres } During the War of the First Coalition the Directoire had replaced the National Convention. Five directors then ruled France. As Great Britain was still at war with France, a plan was made to take Egypt from the Ottoman Empire, a British ally. This was Napoleon &apos;s idea and the Directoire agreed to the plan in order to send the popular general away from the mainland. Napoleon defeated the Ottoman forces during the Battle of the Pyramids and sent hundreds of scientists and linguists out to thoroughly explore modern and ancient Egypt. Unexpectedly the British fleet under Admiral Nelson, destroyed the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile. Napoleon planned to move into Syria but was defeated and he returned to France without his army. It surrendered. { Paul Strathern, Napoleon in Egypt (2009) } The Directoire was threatened by the Second Coalition. Royalists and their allies still dreamed of restoring the monarchy to power, while the Prussian and Austrian crowns did not accept their territorial losses during the previous war. The Russian army expelled the French from Italy in battles such as Cassano while the Austrian army defeated the French in Switzerland at Stockach and Zurich. Napoleon then seized power through a coup and established the Consulate in 1799. The Austrian army was defeated at Marengo in 1800 and again at Hohenlinden. While at sea the French had some success at Boulogne but Nelson&apos;s Royal Navy destroyed an anchored Danish and Norwegian fleet at Copenhagen because the Scandinavian kingdoms were against the British blockade on France. The Second Coalition was beaten and peace was settled in two distinct treaties: The Treaty of Lunéville and the Treaty of Amiens. A brief interlude of peace ensued in 1802-3, during which Napoleon sold French Louisiana to the United States because it was indefensible. { George F. Nafziger, Historical Dictionary of the Napoleonic Era (2002) } In 1801 Napoleon concluded a &quot; Concordat &quot; with Pope Pius VII that opened peaceful relations between church and state in France. The policies of the Revolution were reversed—except the Church did not get its lands back. Bishops and clergy were to receive state salaries and the government paid for the building and maintenance of churches. { Nigel Aston, Religion and revolution in France, 1780-1804 (2000) p 324 } Napoleon reorganized higher learning by dividing the Institut National into four (later five) academies. Of permanent importance was the Napoleonic Code created by eminent jurists under Napoleon&apos;s supervision. Praised for its Gallic clarity, it spread rapidly throughout Europe and the world in general, and marked the end of feudalism and the liberation of Jews where it took effect. { Alexander Grab, Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe (2003) } The Code recognized the principles of civil liberty, equality before the law, and the secular character of the state. It discarded the old right of primogeniture (where only the eldest son inherited) and required that inheritances be divided equally among all the children. The court system was standardized; all judges were appointed by the national government in Paris. { Pierre Goubert, The Course of French History (1991) ch 14 } In 1804 Napoleon was titled Emperor by the senate, thus founding the French Empire. Napoleon&apos;s rule was constitutional, and although autocratic, it was much more advanced than traditional European monarchies of the time. The proclamation of the French Empire was met by the Third Coalition. The French army was renamed the Grande Armée in 1805 and Napoleon used propaganda and nationalism to control the French population. The French army achieved a resounding victory at Ulm, where an entire Austrian army was captured. However, a Franco-Spanish fleet was defeated at Trafalgar and all plans to invade Britain were then made impossible. Despite this naval defeat, it was on the ground that this war would be won, Napoleon inflicted the Austrian and Russian Empires one of their greatest defeats at Austerlitz, destroying the third coalition. The peace was settled in the Treaty of Pressburg, the Austrian Empire lost the title of Holy Roman Emperor and the Confederation of the Rhine was created by Napoleon over former Austrian territories. { Robert P. Goetz, 1805: Austerlitz: Napoleon and the Destruction of the Third Coalition, (2005) } { Battle of Austerlitz, by } { François Gérard } Prussia joined Britain and Russia, thus forming the Fourth Coalition. Although the Coalition was joined by other allies, the French Empire was also not alone since it now had a complex network of allies and submitted states. Largely outnumbered, the Prussian army was crushed at Jena-Auerstedt in 1806, Napoleon captured Berlin and went as far as Eastern Prussia. There the Russian Empire was defeated at the Battle of Friedland. Peace was dictated in the Treaties of Tilsit, in which Russia had to join the Continental System and Prussia handed down half of its territories to France. The Duchy of Warsaw was formed over these territorial losses, and the Polish troops entered the Grande Armée in significant numbers. { First Empire } Freed from his obligation in the east, Napoleon then went back to the west, as the French Empire was still at war with Britain. Only two countries remained neutral in the war: Sweden and Portugal, and Napoleon then looked toward the latter. In the Treaty of Fontainebleau, a Franco-Spanish alliance against Portugal was sealed as Spain eyed Portuguese territories. French armies entered Spain in order to attack Portugal, but then seized Spanish fortresses and took over the kingdom by surprise. Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon&apos;s brother, was made King of Spain after Charles IV &apos;s abdication. This occupation of the Iberian peninsula fueled local nationalism, and soon the Spanish and Portuguese would fight the French using guerilla tactics, defeating the French forces at the Battle of Bailén. Britain sent a short-lived ground support force to Portugal, and French forces evacuated Portugal as defined in the Convention of Sintra following the Allied victory at Vimeiro. France was only controlling Catalonia and Navarre and could have been definitely expelled from the Iberian peninsula had the Spanish armies attacked again, but the Spanish did not. Another French attack was launched on Spain, led by Napoleon himself, and was described as &quot; an avalanche of fire and steel. &quot; However, the French Empire was no longer regarded as invincible by European powers. In 1808 Austria formed the War of the Fifth Coalition in order to break down the French Empire. The Austrian Empire defeated the French at Aspern-Essling, yet was beaten at Wagram while the Polish allies defeated the Austrian Empire at Raszyn. Although not as decisive as the previous Austrian defeats, the peace treaty caused Austria to lose a large amount of territories, reducing it even more. { Adolf Northern } In 1812 war broke out with Russia, engaging Napoleon in the disastrous Patriotic War. Napoleon assembled the largest army Europe had ever seen, including troops from all submitted states, to invade Russia, which had just left the continental system and was gathering an army on the Polish frontier. Following an exhausting march and the bloody but inconclusive Battle of Borodino, near Moscow, the Grande Armée entered and captured Moscow, just to find it burning, as part of the Russian scorched earth tactics. Although there still were battles such as Maloyaroslavets the Napoleonic army left Russia decimated most of all by the Russian winter, exhaustion and scorched earth warfare. On the Spanish front the French troops were defeated at Vitoria and then at the Battle of the Pyrenees. Since the Spanish guerrillas seemed to be uncontrollable, the French troops eventually evacuated Spain. France having been defeated on these two fronts, the states controlled and previously conquered by Napoleon saw a good opportunity to strike back. The Sixth Coalition was formed and the German states of the Confederation of the Rhine switched sides, finally opposing Napoleon. Napoleon was largely defeated in the Battle of the Nations and was overwhelmed by much larger armies during the Six Days Campaign, although, because of the much larger amount of casualties suffered by the allies, the Six Days Campaign is often considered a tactical masterpiece. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814, and was exiled to Elba. The conservative Congress of Vienna reversed the political changes that had occurred during the wars. Napoleon&apos;s attempted restoration, a period known as the Hundred Days, ended with his final defeat at Waterloo in 1815. The monarchy was subsequently restored and Louis XVIII became king. [ Long nineteenth century, 1815–1914 ] [ France in the long nineteenth century ] The seemingly timeless world of the French peasantry swiftly changed from 1870 to 1914. French peasants had been poor and backward until railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription modernized rural France. The centralized government in Paris had the goal of creating a unified nation state, so it required all students be taught standardized French. In the process a new national identity was forged. { Eugen Weber, Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1890–1914 (1976). } [ Bourbon restoration: 1814–1830 ] This period of time is called the Bourbon Restoration and was marked by conflicts between reactionary Ultra-royalists, who wanted to restore the pre-1789 system of absolute monarchy, and liberals, who wanted to strengthen constitutional monarchy. Louis XVIII was the younger brother of Louis XVI, and reigned from 1814 to 1824. On becoming king, Louis issued a constitution known as the Charter which preserved many of the liberties won during the French Revolution and provided for a parliament composed of an elected Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Peers that was nominated by the king. However the right to vote in elections to the Chamber of Deputies was restricted to only the wealthiest men. Louis was succeeded in turn by a younger brother, Charles X, who reigned from 1824 to 1830. On 12 June 1830 Polignac, King Charles X &apos;s minister, exploited the weakness of the Algerian Dey by invading Algeria and establishing French rule in Algeria. { Albert Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959) p. 293. } However, the news of the fall of Algiers had barely reached Paris when a new revolution broke out and quickly resulted in a change of regime. [ July Monarchy 1830–1848 ] Protest against the absolute monarchy was in the air. The elections of deputies to the 16 May 1830 had gone very badly for King Charles X. { Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959) p. 287. } Charles X reacted by proroguing the Chamber of Deputies and sending them all packing, and then unilaterally changed the electional laws in an attempt to create a new Chamber of Deputies more favorable to him, and muzzled the press. Opposition to the absolute monarchy was immediately expressed in the streets of Paris as suppressed deputies, gagged journalists, students from the University and many working men of Paris poured into the streets and erected barricades during the &quot; three glorious days &quot; (French Les Trois Glorieuses) of 26–29 July 1830. Charles X was deposed and replaced by King Louis-Philippe in what is known as the July Revolution. The July Revolution is traditionally regarded as a rising of the bourgeoisie against the absolute monarchy of the Bourbons. Participants in the July Revolution included Marie Joseph Paul Ives Roch Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette. Working behind the scenes on behalf of the bourgeois propertied interests was Louis Adolphe Thiers. Thiers was perfectly willing to see changes made in the government so long as property was not harmed. Thiers wanted the &quot; middle class accommodated &quot; with the vote realizing that, ironically, although the petty bourgeoisie (the inn and cafe keepers, restaurant owners, wine merchants, small traders, shop keepers, handicraftsmen, etc.) were all being ruined by the rise of the larger bourgeoisie that the petty bourgeoisie remained strong supporters of property interests. Lafayette believed the Orleanist constitutional monarchy was the safest course for the propertied interests and so Lafayette and Thiers became supporters of the Orleanist &quot; Citizen King &quot; -- Louis-Philippe.Consequently, Louis-Philippe became &quot; king by the grace of the barricades. &quot; { Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959) p. 291. } Louis-Philippe&apos;s &quot; July Monarchy &quot; (1830–1848) was dominated by the haute bourgeoisie (high bourgeoisie) of bankers, financiers, industrialists and merchants. During the reign of the July Monarchy, the Romantic Era was starting to bloom. Driven by the Romantic Era, an atmosphere of protest and revolt was all around in France. On 22 November 1831 in Lyon (the second largest city in France) the silk workers revolted and took over the town hall in protest of recent salary reductions and working conditions. This was one of the first occasions of a workers revolt in the entire world. { Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959) p. 294. } The revolt was vigorously put down by Casimir Perier. The Right was also unhappy with the July Monarchy. On 28 October 1836, Prince Louis-Napoleon, son of Napoleon&apos;s brother, Louis, King of Holland attempted to overthrow the July Monarchy in a coup d&apos;état. It failed but in August 1840, Prince Louis Napoleon tried another coup at Boulogne with hired soldiers. It failed as well. { Phillip Guedalla, The Second Empire (1923) pp. 18-90, 120-26. } Because of the constant threats to the throne, the July Monarchy began to rule with a stronger and stronger hand. Soon political meetings were outlawed. However, &quot; banquets &quot; were still legal and all through 1847, there was a nation-wide campaign of democracy and/or republican banquets. The climaxing banquet was scheduled for 22 February 1848 in Paris but the government banned it. In response citizens of all classes poured out onto the streets of Paris in a revolt against the July Monarchy. Demands were made for abdication of &quot; Citizen King &quot; Louis-Phillipe and for establishment of a representative democracy in France. [ Maurice Agulhon The Republican Experiment, 1848-1852 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DW9XFC28uLNIC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA23 1983 Cambridge University Press 23–40 ] Representative classes in this revolt included the full range of French society from the industrial bourgeoisie (who had been excluded from the &quot; finance aristocracy &quot; that formed the major part of the bourgeoisie that supported the July Monarchy), the petty bourgeoisie and the workers. Louis-Phillipe abdicated, and the French Second Republic was proclaimed. A Constituent Assembly was elected which was seated in Paris. Alphonse Marie Louis de Lamartine, who had been a leader of the moderate republicans in France during the 1840s became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Provisional Government that was established by this Assembly. In reality Lamartine was the virtual head of government in 1848. { Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer, France in the nineteenth century, 1830-1890 (1892) ch 7 pp 125-49 online } [ Napoleon III: 1848–1871 ] Napoleon III, Emperor of the French Frustration among the laboring classes arose when the Constituent Assembly did not address the concerns of the workers. Strikes and worker demonstrations became more common as the workers gave vent to these frustrations. These demonstrations reached a climax when on 15 May 1848, workers from the secret societies broke out in armed uprising against the anti-labor and anti-democratic policies being pursued by the Constituent Assembly and the Provisional Government. Fearful of a total breakdown of law and order, the Provisional Government invited General Louis Eugene Cavaignac back from Algeria, in June 1848, to put down the worker&apos;s armed revolt. From June 1848 until December 1848 General Cavaignac became head of the executive of the Provisional Government. { William Fortescue, France and 1848: the end of monarchy (2005) p. 130 } Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was elected president on 10 December 1848 by a landslide. His support came from a wide section of the French public. Various classes of French society voted for Louis Napoleon for very different and often contradictory reasons. { Fortescue, France and 1848: the end of monarchy (2005) p. 135 } Louis Napoleon, himself encouraged this contradiction by &quot; being all things to all people. &quot; One of his major promises to the peasantry and other groups was that there would be no new taxes. The new National Constituent Assembly was heavily composed of royalist symphathizers of both the Legitimist (Bourbon) wing and the Orleanist (Citizen King Louis Phiippe) wing. Because of the ambiguity surrounding Louis Napoleon&apos;s political positions, his agenda as president was very much in doubt. For prime minister, he selected Odilon Barrot, an unobjectionable middle-road parliamentarian, who had led the &quot; loyal opposition &quot; under Louis-Philippe. Other appointees represented various royalist factions. { T. A. B. Corley, Democratic Despot: A Life of Napoleon III (1961) pp 74-77 } As part of the Revolutions of 1848, The Pope was forced out of Rome and Louis Napoleon sent a 14,000 man expeditionary force of troops to the Papal State under General Nicolas Charles Victor Oudinot to restore him. In late April, 1849, it was defeated and pushed back from Rome by Giuseppi Garibaldi &apos;s volunteer corps, then recovered and recaptured Rome. { Guérard, France: A Modern History, p. 305. } In the &quot; June Days &quot; of 1849 demonstrations against the government broke out and were suppressed. Leaders were arrested, including prominent politicians. The government banned several democratic and socialist newspapers in France; the editors were arrested. Karl Marx was at risk so he moved to London in August. [ Maurice Agulhon The Republican Experiment, 1848-1852 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DW9XFC28uLNIC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA23 1983 Cambridge U.P. 78-80 ] The government sought ways to balance its budget and reduce its debts. Toward this end, Hippolyte Passy was appointed Finance Minister. When the Legislative Assembly met at the beginning of October, 1849, Passy proposed an income tax to help balance the finances in France. The bourgeoisie, who would pay most of the tax, protested. The furor over the income tax caused the resignation of Barrot as prime minister, but a new wine tax also caused protests. [ Maurice Agulhon The Republican Experiment, 1848-1852 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DW9XFC28uLNIC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA23 1983 Cambridge U.P. 117-38 ] The 1850 elections resulted in a conservative body. It passed the Falloux Laws giving education into the hand of the Catholic clergy. It opened an era of cooperation between Church and state that lasted until the Ferry laws reversed course in 1879. The Fallous laws provided universal primary schooling in France and expanded opportunities for secondary schooling. In practice, the curricula in Catholic and state schools were similar. Catholic schools were especially useful in schooling for girls, which had long been neglected. { Patrick J. Harrigan, &quot; Church, State, and Education in France From the Falloux to the Ferry Laws: A Reassessment, &quot; Canadian Journal of History, (2001) 36#1 pp 51-83 } Although a new electoral law was passed which respected the principle of universal (male) suffrage, the stricter residential requirement of the new law actually had the effect of disenfranchising 3,000,000 of 10,000,000 voters. { Albert Guérard, France: A Modern History, pp. 305-306. } As 1851 opened, Louis Napoleon was not allowed by the Constitution of 1848 to seek re-election as President of France. { Philip Guedalla, The Second Empire p. 203. } Instead he proclaimed himself President for Life following a coup in December that was confirmed and accepted in a dubious referendum. Napoleon III of France took the imperial title in 1852 and held it until his downfall in 1870. The era saw great industrialization, urbanization (including the massive rebuilding of Paris by Baron Haussmann ) and economic growth, but Napoleon III&apos;s foreign policies were not so successful. In 1854, The Second Empire joined the Crimean War, which saw France and Britain opposed to the Russian Empire, who were decisively defeated at Sevastopol in 1855 and at Inkerman. In 1856 France joined the Second Opium War on the British side against China; a missionary&apos;s murder was used as a pretext to take interests in southwest Asia in the Treaty of Tientsin. In 1859 the Second Italian War of Independence broke out between the northern Italian kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia and Austria. The Second French Empire joined the war on the Italian side, which was concluded by an Austrian defeat at Solferino. In return for this intervention, Piedmont ceded the County of Nice (which included the city of Nice and the rugged Alpine territory to its north and east) and the Duchy of Savoy. In 1861 Napoleon III largely supported Maximilian in his claim to Mexico, a move that was also supported by Britain and Spain but condemned by the U.S. This led to the French intervention in Mexico, which turned out to be a failure. When France was negotiating with The Netherlands about purchasing Luxembourg, the Prussian Kingdom threatened the French government with war. This came as a shock to French diplomats as there previously was an agreement between the Prussian and French governments about Luxembourg. Napoleon III suffered stronger and stronger criticism from Republicans like Jules Favre, and his position seemed more fragile with the passage of time. France was looking for more interests in Asia and interfered in Korea in 1866 taking, once again, missionaries&apos; murders as a pretext. The French finally withdrew from the war with little gain but war&apos;s booty. The next year a French expedition to Japan was formed to help the Tokugawa shogunate to modernize its army. However, Tokugawa was defeated during the Boshin War at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi by large Imperial armies. Rising tensions in 1869 about the possible candidacy of Prince Leopold von Hohenzollern -Sigmaringen to the throne of Spain, caused a rise in the scale of animosity between France and Germany. { H. w. Koch, A History of Prussia (Dorset Press, New York, 1978) pp. 265–266. } Prince Leopold was a part of the Prussian royal family. He had been asked by the Spanish Cortes to accept the vacant throne of Spain. Such an event was more than France could possibly accept. Relations between France and Germany deteriorated and finally, the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) broke out. German nationalism united the German states, with the exception of Austria, against Napoleon III. The French Empire was defeated decisively at Metz and Sedan. Indeed, Emperor Louis Napoleon III surrendered himself and 100,000 French troops to the German troops at Sedan on 1 September through 2, 1870. { Guèrard, p. 324. } Two days later, on 4 September 1870, Leon Gambetta proclaimed a new republic in France. { William L. Shirer, The Collapse of the Third Republic (Simon &amp; Shuster: New York, 1969) p. 36. } Later when Paris was encircled by German troops, Gambetta fled Paris by means of a hot air balloon and he became the virtual dictator of the war effort which was carried on from the rural provinces. { Guérard, p. 325. } Metz remained under siege until 27 October 1870, when 173,000 French troops were located there finally surrendered. Surrounded Paris and was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. The last straw was the Siege of Paris. The Treaty of Frankfurt allowed the newly formed German Empire to annex the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. { Guérard, p. 326. } [ Railways ] [ History of rail transport in France ] Railways became a national medium for the modernization of backward regions, and a leading advocate of this approach was the poet-politician Alphonse de Lamartine. One writer hoped that railways might improve the lot of &quot; populations two or three centuries behind their fellows &quot; and eliminate &quot; the savage instincts born of isolation and misery. &quot; Consequently, France built a centralized system that radiated from Paris (plus lines that cut east to west in the south). This design was intended to achieve political and cultural goals rather than maximize efficiency. After some consolidation, six companies controlled monopolies of their regions, subject to close control by the government in terms of fares, finances, and even minute technical details. The central government department of Ponts et Chaussées [roads and bridges] brought in British engineers and workers, handled much of the construction work, provided engineering expertise and planning, land acquisition, and construction of permanent infrastructure such as the track bed, bridges and tunnels. It also subsidized militarily necessary lines along the German border, which was considered necessary for the national defense. Private operating companies provided management, hired labor, laid the tracks, and built and operated stations. They purchased and maintained the rolling stock—6,000 locomotives were in operation in 1880, which averaged 51,600 passengers a year or 21,200 tons of freight. Much of the equipment was imported from Britain and therefore did not stimulate machinery makers. Although starting the whole system at once was politically expedient, it delayed completion, and forced even more reliance on temporary experts brought in from Britain. Financing was also a problem. The solution was a narrow base of funding through the Rothschilds and the closed circles of the Bourse in Paris, so France did not develop the same kind of national stock exchange that flourished in London and New York. The system did help modernize the parts of rural France it reached, but it did not help create local industrial centers. Critics such as Emile Zola complained that it never overcame the corruption of the political system, but rather contributed to it. The railways probably helped the industrial revolution in France by facilitating a national market for raw materials, wines, cheeses, and imported manufactured products. Yet the goals set by the French for their railway system were moralistic, political, and military rather than economic. As a result, the freight trains were shorter and less heavily loaded than those in such rapidly industrializing nations such as Britain, Belgium or Germany. Other infrastructure needs in rural France, such as better roads and canals, were neglected because of the expense of the railways, so it seems likely that there were net negative effects in areas not served by the trains. { Patrick O’Brien, Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830–1914 (1983) } [ The Third Republic and the Belle Epoque ] [ French Third Republic ] Following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, Otto von Bismarck proposed harsh terms for peace—including the German occupation of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. A new French National Assembly was elected to consider the German terms for peace. Elected on 8 February 1871, this new National Assembly was composed of 650 deputies. Sitting in Bourdeaux, the French National Assembly established the Third Republic. However, 400 members of the new Assembly were monarchists. { William L. Shirer, The Collapse of the Third Republic Simon and Schuster: New York, 1969) p. 35. } ( Leon Gambetta was one of the &quot; non-monarchist &quot; Republicans that were elected to the new National Assembly from Paris. { Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959) p. 326. } ) On 16 February 1871 Adolphe Thiers was elected to be the chief executive of the new Republic. Because of the revolutionary unrest in Paris, the center of the Thiers government was located at Versailles. A barricade in the Paris Commune, March 18, 1871. [ Crushing of the Paris Commune ] In late 1870-early 1871 the workers of Paris rose up in premature and unsuccessful small-scale uprisings. The National Guard within Paris had become increasingly restive and defiant of the police, the army chief of staff and even their own National Guard commanders. Thiers immediately recognized a revolutionary situation and on 18 March 1871, sent regular army units to take control of artillery that belonged to the National Guard of Paris. However, some soldiers of the regular army units fraternized with the rebels and the revolt escalated. The barricades went up just as in 1830 and 1848. The Paris Commune was born. Once again the Hotel de Ville, or Town Hall became center of attention for the people in revolt. This time the Hotel de Ville became the seat of the revolutionary government. Other cities in France followed the example of the Paris Commune, as in Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse. However, all of these Communes outside Paris were promptly crushed by the Thiers government. { Eugene Schulkind, ed. The Paris Commune 1871 pp. 22–23. } An election on 26 March 1871 in Paris produced a government based on the working class. [ May 2012 ] Louis Auguste Blanqui was in prison but a majority of delegates were his followers, called &quot; Blanquists. [ May 2012 ] The minority comprised anarchists and followers of Pierre Joseph Proudhon (1809–1855). [ May 2012 ] As anarchists, the &quot; Proudhonists &quot; were supporters of limited or no government and wanted the revolution to follow an ad hoc course with little or no planning. [ May 2012 ] Analysis of arrests records indicate the typical communard was opposed to the military, the clerics, the rural aristocrats. [ May 2012 ] He saw as the enemy the bourgeoisie. [ May 2012 ] After two months the French army moved in to retake Paris, with pitched battles fought in working class neighborhoods. Hundreds were executed in front of the Communards&apos; Wall, while thousands of others were marched to Versailles for trials. The number killed during La Semaine Sanglante (The Bloody Week of 21 May through 28 May 1871) was perhaps 30,000, with as many as 50,000 later executed or imprisoned; 7,000 were exiled to New Caledonia. Thousands more escaped to exile. The government won approval for its actions in a national referendum with 321,000 in favor and only 54,000 opposed. { Patrick H. Hutton et al., eds. Historical Dictionary of the Third French Republic, 1870-1940 (Greenwood, 1986) p. 215. } [ Political battles ] The Republican government next had to confront counterrevolutionaries who rejected the legacy of the 1789 Revolution. Both the Legitimist, embodied in the person of Henri, Count of Chambord, grandson of Charles X; and the Orleanist royalist s rejected republicanism, which they saw as an extension of modernity and atheism, breaking with France&apos;s traditions. This conflict became increasingly sharp in 1873, when Thiers, himself was censured by the National Assembly as not being &quot; sufficiently conservative &quot; and resigned to make way for Marshal Patrice MacMahon as the new president. { Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959), pp. 328–329 } Amidst the rumors of right wing intrigue and/or coups by the Bonapartists or the Bourbons in 1874, the National Assembly set about drawing up a new constitution which would be acceptable to all parties. The new constitution provided for universal male suffrage and called for a bi-cameral legislature, consisting of a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies. The first election under this new constitution held in early 1876 resulted in a republican victory, with 363 republicans elected as opposed to 180 monarchists. However, 75 of the monarchists elected to the new Chamber of Deputies were Bonapartists. { William L. Shirer, The Collapse of the Third Republic p. 39. } The &quot; Bonapartist threat &quot; of a coup de etat was an ever-present danger in these early days of the Republic. Under the constitution, President MacMahon was required to pick a &quot; premier &quot; to actually lead the day-to-day affairs of the government. The most natural leader to pick following this republican victory at the polls would have been Leon Gambetta. However, the old Marshal was dead set against Gambetta and chose, instead, moderate Armand Dufaure. Dufaure tried to form a government but he was quickly overthrown. Next Marshall MacMahon chose conservative Jules Simon. He was too conservative for the Chamber of Deputies and Simon was forced to resign on 16 May 1877, setting the stage for the &quot; Crisis of the Sixteenth of May. &quot; [ William Fortescue The Third Republic in France, 1870-1940: Conflicts and Continuities http://books.google.com/books?id%3DVzfBh4eQsPQC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA33 2000 Psychology Press ] The 16 May 1877 crisis eventually led to the resignation of royalist Marshal MacMahon in January 1879. During his life Henri, comte de Chambord, who, as the grandson of Charles X, had refused to abandon the fleur-de-lys and the white flag. Thus, Henri&apos;s own short-sightedness in this regard jeopardized the alliance between Legitimists (Bourbons) and Orleanists. Therefore, the monarchist cause remained divided did not present as strong a threat to the Third Republic as might have been the case had they been unified. Because of this division many remaining Orleanists rallied themselves to the Republic, behind Adolphe [ fra Thiers ]. The vast majority of the Legitimists abandoned the political arena or became marginalised. Still they remained a potent threat of trouble for the young Third Republic, especially while Henri Count of Chabord lived. When he died on 24 August 1883, the Third Republic had a large threat to its existence removed. Marshal MacMahon&apos;s successor as President of the Republic on 30 January 1879 was Jules Grevy. In January 1886, Georges Boulanger became Minister of War. Georges Clemanceau was instrumental in obtaining this appointment for Boulanger. This was the start of the Boulanger era, and was the start of another time of threats. [ Arthur Augustus Tilley Modern France: A Companion to French Studies 1967 CUP Archive 170 GGKEY:KFSQL2KCR5A ] Following the death of Henri Count of Chabord, the Legitimist (Bourbon) party was limited within the political arena within France. Some of them founded Action Française in 1898, during the Dreyfus Affair; it became an influential movement throughout the 1930s, in particular among the conservative Catholic intellectuals. The initial republic was in effect led by pro-royalists, but republicans (the &quot; Radicals &quot; ) and Bonapartists scrambled for power. The period from 1879–1899 saw power come into the hands of moderate republicans and former &quot; radicals &quot; (around Léon Gambetta ); these were called the &quot; Opportunists &quot;. The newly found Republican control of the Republic allowed the vote of the 1881 and 1882 Jules Ferry laws on a free, mandatory and laic public education. The moderates however became deeply divided over the Dreyfus Affair, and this allowed the Radicals eventually to gain power from 1899 until World War I. During this period, crises like the potential &quot; Boulangist &quot; coup d&apos;état in 1889, showed the fragility of the republic. The Radicals&apos; policies on education (suppression of local languages, compulsory education), mandatory military service, and control of the working classes eliminated internal dissent and regionalisms. Their participation in the Scramble for Africa and in the acquiring of overseas possessions (such as French Indochina ) created myths of French greatness. Both of these processes transformed a country of regionalisms into a modern nation state. Conflicts between the Chinese Emperor and the French Republic over Indochina climaxed during the Sino-French War. Admiral Courbet destroyed the Chinese fleet anchored at Foochow. The treaty ending the war, put France in a protectorate over northern and central Vietnam, which it divided into Tonkin and Annam. { Frederic Wakeman, Jr., The Fall of Imperial China (Free Press: New York, 1975) pp. 189–191. } In an effort to isolate Germany, France went to great pains to woo Russia and the United Kingdom to its side, first by means of the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894, the 1904 Entente Cordiale with the U.K, and finally, with the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907 which became the Triple Entente and eventually led Russia and the UK to enter World War I as Allies. France still had interests in Asia and looked for alliances and found in Japan a possible ally. During his visit to France, Iwakura Tomomi asked for French assistance in reforming Japan. French military missions were sent to Japan in 1872–1880, in 1884–1889 and the last one much later in 1918–1919 to help modernize the Japanese army. Distrust of Germany, faith in the army and native French anti-semitism combined to make the Dreyfus Affair (the unjust trial and condemnation of a Jewish military officer for treason) a political scandal of the utmost gravity. The nation was divided between &quot; dreyfusards &quot; and &quot; anti-dreyfusards &quot;, and far-right Catholic agitators inflamed the situation even when proofs of Dreyfus&apos; innocence came to light. The writer Emile Zola published an impassioned editorial on the injustice, and was himself condemned by the government for libel. Once Dreyfus was finally pardoned, the progressive legislature enacted the 1905 laws on laïcité, which created a complete separation of church and state and stripped churches of most of their property rights. Eiffel Tower under construction in July 1888. The period at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century is often termed the belle époque. Although associated with cultural innovations and popular amusements (cabaret, can-can, the cinema, new art forms such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau ), France was nevertheless a nation divided internally on notions of religion, class, regionalisms and money, and on the international front France came repeatedly to the brink of war with the other imperial powers, including Great Britain (the Fashoda Incident ). World War I was inevitable, but its human and financial costs would be catastrophic for the French. In 1889 the Exposition Universelle took place in Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was built as a temporary gate to the fair. Meant to last only a few decades, the tower was never removed and became France&apos;s most iconic landmark. [ Lucien Hervé Barry Bergdoll The Eiffel Tower http://books.google.com/books?id%3DXJvlC5e8Hb8C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA16 2003 Princeton Architectural Press 16 ] [ Since 1914 ] [ France in the twentieth century ] [ World War I ] [ World War I ] [ World War I casualties ] A French bayonet charge in World War I Preoccupied with internal problems, France played little attention to foreign policy in the 1911-14 period, although it did extend military service to three years from two over strong Socialist objections in 1913. The rapidly escalating Balkan crisis of 1914 caught France unawares, and it played only a small role in the coming of World War I. The Serbian crisis triggered a complex set of formal and secret military alliances between European states, causing most of the continent, including France, to be drawn into war within a few short weeks. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in late July, triggering Russian mobilization. On 1 August both Germany and France ordered mobilization. Germany was much better prepared militarily than any of the other countries involved, including France. Later on that day the German Empire, as an ally of Austria, declared war on Russia. France was allied with Russia and so was ready to commit to war against the German Empire. Germany on August 3 declared war on France, going through Belgium. Britain entered the war on 4 August, and started sending in troops on 7 August. { Verdun. &quot; &apos;&apos; } { They shall not pass &quot; &apos;&apos; is a phrase which for all time will be associated with the heroic defense of Verdun. } Germany&apos;s plan was to defeat the French quickly. They captured Brussels by 20 August and soon had captured a large portion of northern France. The original plan was to continue southwest and attack Paris from the west. By early September they were within 40 miles of Paris, and the French government had relocated to Bordeaux. The Allies finally stopped the advance northeast of Paris at the Marne River. [ Holger H. Herwig The Marne, 1914: The Opening of World War I and the Battle That Changed the World http://books.google.com/books?id%3DuIYgL6NKyMwC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA40 2011 Random House 266–306 ] The war now became a stalemate--the famous &quot; Western Front &quot; was fought largely in France and characterized by very little movement despite extremely large and violent battles, often with new and more destructive military technology. Famous battles in France include First Battle of the Marne, Battle of Verdun, Battle of the Somme and the Second Battle of the Marne. On the Western Front the small improvised trenches of the first few months rapidly grew deeper and more complex, gradually becoming vast areas of interlocking defensive works. The land war quickly became dominated by the muddy, bloody stalemate of Trench warfare, a form of war in which both opposing armies had static lines of defense. The war of movement quickly turned into a war of position. Attack followed others counterattack after counterattack. Neither side advanced much, but both sides suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. German and Allied armies produced essentially a matched pair of trench lines from the Swiss border in the south to the North Sea coast of Belgium. Trench warfare prevailed on the Western Front from September 1914 until March 1918. The space between the opposing trenches was referred to as &quot; no man&apos;s land &quot; (for its lethal uncrossability) and varied in width depending on the battlefield. On the Western Front it was typically between 100 and 300 yards (90–275 m), though sometimes much less. The common infantry soldier had four weapons to use in the trenches: the rifle, bayonet, shotgun, and hand grenade, but the only defense against machine guns and artillery was to stay low low in the trenches. [ G. D. Sheffield War on the Western Front http://books.google.com/books?id%3D2tZK2eEqM_gC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA194 2007 Osprey Publishing passim ] Britain introduced the first tanks to the war, while Renault enhanced the concept by adding a turret. The use in large quantity of these light tanks by Jean-Baptiste Estienne can be considered a decisive evolution in World War I&apos;s strategies. A French woman returns when the Germans retreat from her district and finds her home in ruins. When Russia exited the war in 1917 due to revolution, the Central Powers controlled all of the Balkans and could now shift military efforts to the Western Front. The U.S. had entered the war also in 1917, so the Central Powers hoped this could be achieved mostly prior to America&apos;s delivery of military support. In March 1918 Germany launched the last major offensive on the Western Front. By May Germany had reached the Marne again, as in September 1914, and was again close to Paris. In Second Battle of the Marne, however, the Allies were able to defend and then shift to offense due in part to the fatigue of the Germans and the arrival of more Americans. The Germans, out of reinforcements, were overwhelmed day after day and the high command saw it was hopeless. Austria and Turkey collapsed, the Kaiser&apos;s government fell, and Germany signed a surrender—the &quot; Armistice &quot; -- that ended the fighting on November 11, 1918. The war was fought in large part on French soil, with 1.4  million French dead including civilians, and four times as many military casualties. [ Peace terms ] { David Lloyd George, } { Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, } { Georges Clemenceau and } { Woodrow Wilson in Versailles } Peace terms were imposed by the Big Four —Clemenceau demanded the harshest terms and won most of them in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Germany was forced to admit its guilt for starting the war, and was permanently weakened militarily. France regained Alsace-Lorraine. Germany had to pay huge sums war reparations to the Allies (who in turn had large loans from the U.S. to pay off). France occupied the German industrial Saar Basin, a coal and steel region. The German African colonies put under League of Nations mandates, and were adminsitered by France and other victors. From the remains of the Ottoman Empire, France acquired the Mandate of Syria and the Mandate of Lebanon. [ Patrick O.

From 1925 until his death in 1932, Aristide Briand, as prime minister during five short intervals, directed French foreign policy, using his diplomatic skills and sense of timing to forge friendly relations with Weimar Germany as the basis of a genuine peace within the framework of the League of Nations. He realized France could neither contain Germany by itself—it was much larger—nor secure effective support from Britain or the League. { Eugen Weber, The Hollow Years: France in the 1930s (1996) p 125 } The French economy was in the doldrums during the worldwide Great Depression after 1929. Leon Blum, leading the Popular Front brought together Socialists and Communists to become Prime Minister from 1936 to 1937; he was the first Jew to lead France. During the Spanish Civil War he did not support the Spanish Republicans because of the French internal political context of complex alliances and risk of war with Germany and Italy. In the 1920s, France established an elaborate system of border defences (the Maginot Line ), designed to fight off any German attack. The Maginot line did not extend into Belgium, where Germany attacked in 1940. Military alliances were signed with weak powers called the &quot; Little Entente &quot;. Appeasement of Germany, in cooperation with Britain, was the policy after 1936, as France sought peace, even in the face of Hitler &apos;s violations of the Versailles treaty and his escalating demands. Édouard Daladier refused to go to war against Germany and Italy without British support as Neville Chamberlain wanted to save peace at Munich in 1938.

This movement may well have been the largest single movement of civilians in history prior to 1947. } Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June 1940, and the French leaders surrendered on 24 June 1940 after the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from Dunkirk. Nazi Germany occupied three fifths of France&apos;s territory, leaving the rest in the southeast to the new Vichy government. This regime sought to collaborate with Germany. It was established on 10 July 1940. The Vichy Regime was led by Philippe Pétain, the aging war hero of First World War. It was originally intended to be a temporary, care-taker regime, to supervise French administration before the soon-expected defeat of Britain. Instead, it lasted four years. It was unique among the various collaborating regimes of wartime Europe in that it was established constitutionally, through the French parliament. However, Charles de Gaulle declared himself on Radio Londres the head of a rival government in exile, gathering the Free French Forces around him, finding support in some French colonies and recognition from Britain and the USA. The Vichy regime adopted violent, repressive anti-semitic policies on its own initiative, without direction from Nazi Germany, as has been highlighted by the historian Robert Paxton. { Robert O. Paxton, Vichy France, Old Guard and New Order, New York, 1972 } During the German occupation 76,000 Jews would be deported, often with the help of the Vichy French authorities, and murdered in the Nazis&apos; extermination camp s. After the Attack on Mers-el-Kébir in 1940, where the British fleet destroyed a large part of the French navy, still under command of Vichy France, that killed about 1,100 sailors, there was nationwide indignation and a feeling of distrust in the French forces, leading to the events of the Battle of Dakar. Eventually, several important French ships such as the Richelieu and the Surcouf joined the Free French Forces. On the Eastern Front the USSR was lacking pilots and several French pilots joined the Soviet Union and fought the Luftwaffe in the Normandie-Niemen squadron. Within France proper, very few people organized themselves against the German Occupation in the summer of 1940. However, their numbers grew as the Vichy regime resorted to more strident policies in order to fulfill the enormous demands of the Nazis and the eventual decline of Nazi Germany became more obvious. Isolated opposers eventually formed a real movement: the Resistance. { H. R. Kedward, In Search of the Maquis (Oxford, 1993) } The most famous figure of the French resistance was Jean Moulin, sent in France by De Gaulle in order to link all resistance movements. He was tortured by Klaus Barbie (the &quot; butcher of Lyon &quot; ). Increasing repression culminated in the complete destruction and extermination of the village of Oradour-sur-Glane, at the height of the Battle of Normandy. There were also Frenchmen who joined the SS, they were known as the Charlemagne Division; knowing they would not survive should Germany be defeated, they were among the last ones to surrender at Berlin. { D-Day, 1944 } Whilst recognising this extensive collaboration, the British historian Simon Kitson has shown that the Vichy regime engaged in an extensive programme of arresting German intelligence agents in the unoccupied zone. { Simon Kitson, Vichy et la Chasse aux Espions Nazis, Paris, Autrement, 2005; Simon Kitson, The Hunt for Nazi Spies, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2007 } Around 2000 were arrested and some were subsequently executed. Vichy&apos;s purpose in this respect was to preserve its sovereignty. In November 1942 Vichy France was finally occupied by German forces, because the war in North Africa was coming to an end; the Germans foresaw a threat in southern Europe by the allied forces. On 6 June 1944 the Allies landed in Normandy while on 15 August they landed in Provence (including the 260,000 men of the French army B). General Leclerc freed Paris between 19–25 August 1944, and Strasbourg. He later, along with the battleship Richelieu, represented France at Tokyo during the Japanese surrender. The Vichy regime fled to Germany. The 1st [ March 2010 ] French army recruited French Forces of the Interior fighters to continue the war until the final defeat of Germany. This army numbered 300,000 men by September 1944 and 370,000 by spring in 1945 (the 2nd DB wasn&apos;t in it). France was liberated by allied forces in 1944 [ March 2010 ]. The day Germany surrendered French forces were involved in the Sétif massacre in Algeria. [ November 2011 ] [ Cold War ] [ Provisional Government of the French Republic French Fourth Republic French Fifth Republic ] After liberation a provisional government of the Republic was established led by General Charles de Gaulle, a new constitution (13 October 1946) established the Fourth Republic under a parliamentary form of government controlled by a series of coalitions. During the following 16 years the French Colonial Empire would disintegrate. Israel was established in 1948, and France was one of the fiercest supporters of the Jewish state, supplying it with extensive weaponry it used during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The French Republic needed an alliance with Israel to secure the Suez Canal from potential threats in a context of decolonisation. In Indochina the French government was facing the Viet Minh communist rebels and lost its Indochinese colonies during the First Indochina War in 1954 after the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Vietnam was divided in two states while Cambodia and Laos were made independent. France left Indochina only to be replaced there by the United States, which would soon be engaged in the long Vietnam War. In 1956 another crisis struck French colonies, this time in Egypt. The Suez Canal, having been built by the French government, belonged to the French Republic and was operated by the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez. Great Britain had bought the Egyptian share from Isma&apos;il Pasha and was the second largest owner of the canal before the crisis. The Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the canal despite French and British opposition; he estimated a European answer was most unlikely to happen. Great Britain and France attacked Egypt and built an alliance with Israel against Nasser. Israel attacked from the east, Britain from Cyprus and France from Algeria. Egypt, the most powerful Arab state of the time, was defeated in a mere few days. The Suez crisis caused an outcry of indignation in the entire Arab world and Saudi Arabia set an embargo on oil on France and Britain. The US President Dwight D. Eisenhower forced a ceasefire when he threatened to sell all American shares of British Pounds and to crash the British economy. The British forces were retired from the conflict and Israel, having seized interests in the Sinai region, withdrew soon leaving France alone in Egypt. Under stronger political pressures the French government ultimately evacuated its troops from Suez. This was a major political defeat for France and the American threats during the war were received with indignation by the French popular opinion. This led directly, and was used as a point, to the French withdrawal from the integrated military command of NATO in 1966. Another consequence of this was the French loss of geopolitical interests in the region; this meant an alliance with Israel was no longer of any use for French diplomacy. General de Gaulle was elected president in 1958 and made the French Force de Frappe, the nuclear power, a priority of the French Defence. France then adopted the dissuasion du faible au fort doctrine which meant a Soviet attack on France would only bring total destruction to both sides. [ Within ten years, we shall have the means to kill 80 million Russians. I truly believe that one does not light-heartedly attack people who are able to kill 80  million Russians, even if one can kill 800  million French, that is if there were 800  million French. ] The May 1958 seizure of power in Algiers by French army units and French settlers opposed to concessions in the face of Arab nationalist insurrection led to the fall of the French government and a presidential invitation to de Gaulle to form an emergency government to forestall the threat of civil war. The new constitution of the French Fifth Republic, introduced on 5 October 1958, gave greater powers to the presidency. Algeria became independent in 1962. In May 1968 students revolted, with a variety of demands including educational, labor and governmental reforms, sexual and artistic freedom, and the end of the Vietnam War. The student protest in unruly movements quickly joined with labor, and mass strikes erupted. De Gaulle responded by calling a legislative election for 23 June, in which his UDR party increased their vote, and the protests faded away during the summer. [ Post Cold War ] { Treaty of Nice } After the fall of the USSR and the end of the Cold War potential menaces to mainland France appeared considerably reduced. France began reducing its nuclear capacities and conscription was abolished in 2001. In 1990 France, led by François Mitterrand, joined the short lived Gulf War against Iraq, the French participation to this war would be called the Opération Daguet. However, despite the end of the cold war and the fact future conflicts would be fought away from home, there were still menaces against mainland France in the form of terrorism. In 1994 Air France Flight 8969 was hijacked by Islamic terrorists with the suspected intent to crash the plane over Paris. The hijacking was a failure for the terrorist group, known as the GIA after an intervention from the GIGN in Marseille, where the plane was grounded. More terrorist attacks would happen and these culminated into the 1995 Paris Metro bombing. Important leaders of the GIA in France fell afterward: Khaled Kelkal was killed in Lyon by the EPIGN and Rachid Ramda was arrested in London although it took ten years for the French justice to have him extradited. Jacques Chirac assumed office as president on 17 May 1995, after a campaign focused on the need to combat France&apos;s stubbornly high unemployment rate. While France continues to revere its rich history and independence, French leaders increasingly tie the future of France to the continued development of the European Union. In 1992 France ratified the Maastricht Treaty establishing the European Union. In 1999, the Euro was introduced to replace the French franc. Beyond membership in the European Union, France is also involved in many joint European projects such as Airbus, the Galileo positioning system and the Eurocorps. The French have stood among the strongest supporters of NATO and EU policy in the Balkans to prevent genocide in Yugoslavia. French troops joined the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. France has also been actively involved against international terrorism. In 2002 Alliance Base, an international Counterterrorist Intelligence Center, was secretly established in Paris. The same year France contributed to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, but it strongly rejected the 2003 invasion of Iraq, even threatening to veto in central coners in the US proposed resolution. Jacques Chirac was reelected in 2002, mainly because his socialist rival Lionel Jospin was defeated by the extreme right wing candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen. France was struck by a long period of civil unrest in 2005 after the death of two teenagers. At the end of his second term Jacques Chirac chose not to run again at the age of 74. The cabinet minister and rival Nicolas Sarkozy was elected and took office on 16 May 2007. The problem of high unemployment has yet to be resolved. In 2008, France was one of the first states to recognise Kosovo as an independent nation.

The Kingdom of Romania emerged when the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia were united under Prince Alexander Ioan Cuza in 1859. Independence from the Ottoman Empire was declared on 9 May 1877, and was internationally recognized the following year. At the end of World War I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the Kingdom of Romania. Greater Romania emerged into an era of progression and prosperity that would continue until World War II. By the end of the War, many north-eastern areas of Romania&apos;s territories were occupied by the Soviet Union, and Romania forcibly became a socialist republic and a member of the Warsaw Pact. With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the 1989 Revolution, Romania began its transition towards democracy and a capitalist market economy. After a decade of post-revolution economic problems, extensive reforms fostered economic recovery making Romania now an upper middle-income country with high human development. { Statistics|Human Development Reports (HDR)|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

[ Traditions ] { Painted eggs } In addition to the religious aspects, in Romania Easter also symbolizes the rebirth and the renewal of daily life. It is usual on Easter morning, after the return of villagers from churches, for children to go to neighbors&apos; homes, to bring luck and wealth, in exchange for a red egg. On Christmas Eve, young people carol the village homes, hosts giving in exchange nuts, sponge cakes, apples, pretzels and other delicacies. The Star boys&apos; singing procession is a very important part of the Romanian Christmas festivity. In the week between Christmas and New Year, in all villages, groups of lads prepare for &quot; bid &quot;, a complex system of customs and habits. On the evening, in the eve of respective year which arises promising, are expected to occur &quot; Ursul &quot;, &quot; Capra &quot;, &quot; Bunghierii &quot;, &quot; Căiuții &quot;, &quot; Malanca &quot;, &quot; Jienii &quot;, &quot; Mascații &quot; and others.

Arta populara Traditii.ro 2011-08-29 ] { Sibiu } The Romanian folkloric costumes characterize own attributes of the Romanian people and contribute essentially at the definition of ethnic specificity. Closely related to human existence, the folkloric costume reflected over time, as reflected nowadays, mentality and artistic conception of the people. The folkloric costume has been developed with history, being a genuine expression of coherent tradition s throughout centuries. Distinct clothing ornamentation, traditional methods used for sewing and tailoring the pieces of clothing, and wide variety of costumes from one region to another customize the defining spirit of the Romanian people. For women, one of the most important parts of the celebration costume is a kerchief called maramă. A maramă is made from a special fabric called borangic, which resembles silk, so the texture of the material is really nice and soft. An important aspect is its transparency, given by the weaver in which it&apos;s made. The borangic is obtained from silkworms&apos; cocoons. Every woman grows the silkworms in her own yard, feeding them with mullberry leaves. After approximately 6 weeks, the worms would hide in their cocoons and the person who&apos;s in charge of them should move the cocoons into the sun so the worms die and the silk filament can be extracted. Once all the filaments are extracted, they&apos;re put into a weaver and one woman starts making the maramă. { http://www.unibuc.ro/uploads_ro/48384/1328/CIVILIZATIA_TRADITIONALA.pdf } Also, the folklore of Romania is defined by its mythology, branch of folk literature that integrates a variety of ancestral habits, tale s, fable s and ballad s, whose authors are anonymous. The rural character of the Romanian communities resulted in an exceptionally vital and creative traditional culture. So, in Romanian mythology were conceived fabulous beings, unreal characters endowed with supernatural powers. These include Baba Cloanța, a misshapen and recondite witch, Iele, inconstant virgins endowed with unapproachable ability of seduction and superhuman features, Muma Pădurii, a hag that lives in deep forest, Strigoi, troubled souls of the dead rising from the grave and Făt-Frumos, a knight hero that fights with griffons, dragons and witch es to liberate his heart chosen, Ileana Cosânzeana. { http://andilandi.ro/marul-de-aur/personaje-mitologice-romanesti/ } The words &quot; longing &quot; and &quot; mourning &quot; have correspondent in another language, but the nonfigurative character remains undecipherable and define specificity of the Romanian soul. Doina, characteristic only Romanian literary folklore, represents the lyric creation that Romanian expresses the most varied and complex range of feelings, strongly rooted in his spiritual structure. In the Romanian folkloric tradition, &quot; doina &quot; was played mainly orally or accompanied by a single instrument, being the song of elegy, played for self comforting and not intended for festive events because of its sober nature. [ Cuisine ] [ Romanian cuisine ] { Amandine cakes } Romanian cuisine is a diverse blend of different dishes from several traditions with which it has come into contact, but it also maintains its own character. It has been greatly influenced by Ottoman cuisine but also includes influences from the cuisines of other neighbours, such as the Greeks ( musaca ), Bulgarians ( zacuscă ), Turks ( pilaf ), and Hungarians ( langoși ). Quite different types of dishes are sometimes included under a generic term; for example, the category ciorbă includes a wide range of soups with a characteristic sour taste. These may be meat and vegetable soups, tripe and calf foot soups, or fish soups, all of which are soured by lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, vinegar, or traditionally borș (fermented wheat bran). Popular main courses include mititei, frigărui and the șnițel. One of the most common dishes is mămăliga (similar to the Italian polenta ), and is served on its own or as a side dish. Pork and chicken are the preferred meats, but beef, lamb and fish are also popular. Sarmale are prepared from minced meat (pork, beef, mutton, poultry or fish meat, especially in the Danube Delta), mixed with rice and other aliments (pap, couscous etc.) and wrapped in cabbage (fresh or sour) or vine leaves in the form of rolls. Usually, they are served with polenta and smetana, but can be served with a spoonful of fresh butter. The list of desserts includes names like amandine, clătite, chec, cozonac, gogoși, griș cu lapte, lapte de pasăre etc. In the north-western Romania, are prepared so-called ciureghe, gomboți cu prune, pancove, plăcinte crețe, while in the north-eastern Romania, the traditional desserts are chec cu vișine, tartă cu mere, alivenci moldovenești.

Romania is currently the world&apos;s 9th largest wine producer, and recently [ July 2011 ] the export market has started to grow. Romania produces a wide selection of domestic varieties ( Fetească, Grasă, Tamâioasă, Băbească ), as well as varieties from across the world ( Italian Riesling, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Muscat Ottonel ). Beer is also highly regarded, generally blonde pilsener beer, the traditional methods of preparation being generally influenced by German wheat beers. There are some Romanian breweries with a long tradition, such as Timișoreana, Ursus and Azuga. Since the 19th century, beer has become increasingly popular, and today Romanians are amongst the heaviest beer drinkers in the world.

At Christmas, each family usually sacrifice a pig and prepare a large variety of dishes of its meat and organs ( cârnați, caltaboși, chiftele, tobă, șnițele ).

The writers originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and have subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to the creator of The Simpsons, Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the Canadian sketch comedy show Second City Television.

Club ] [ Agnes Skinner ] Agnes Skinner, voiced by Tress MacNeille is the mother of school principal Seymour Skinner and first appeared in the first season episode &quot; The Crepes of Wrath &quot; as an old woman who embarrassingly calls her son &quot; Spanky &quot;. However, as episodes progressed, the character turned bitter. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { The Crepes of Wrath &quot; } She is very harshly controlling of Seymour, and treats him like a mother would a small child, once grounding him because he did not say who was at the door after answering it, when it was &quot; The Sugarman &quot;. She hates Edna Krabappel. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Special Edna &quot; } Agnes has married a total of four times, once with Skinner&apos;s father, Sheldon Skinner, and following Sheldon&apos;s death she then married three more times, each time, to a tow truck driver. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Midnight Towboy &quot; } Several Springfield residents (including the Simpsons) are afraid of her. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { The Principal and the Pauper &quot; } When Agnes&apos; real son, &quot; the real Seymour Skinner &quot; arrives in Springfield, Agnes turns him away, unhappy with her new living situation, largely because the true Seymour Skinner is a man who can stand up to Agnes and make his own decisions. Although she appears to not care for the fake Skinner, it turns out she really loves him, although she denies it in &quot; Large Marge &quot;. Agnes&apos;s first name was revealed in the seventh season episode &quot; Bart the Fink &quot;. { Richmond, p. 196 } Before that, the character was known as &quot; Mrs. Skinner &quot;. In the beginning of the series, the writers made several references to Agnes and Seymour&apos;s relationship being similar to that of Norman Bates and his mother&apos;s in the film Psycho. { Jean, Al (2003). Easter egg commentary for &quot; } { Separate Vocations &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } In &quot; Boy Meets Curl, &quot; it is revealed that some of Agnes&apos; resentment to Seymour may have derived from even before Seymour was born  — during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Agnes competed in the pole vaulting event while 9-months pregnant. When Seymour makes his first kick, he hits the bar, thus, making Agnes lose and subsequently crushing her dreams. { &quot; } { Boy Meets Curl, &quot; first aired February 14, 2010 } However, this would contradict the earlier episode when it is revealed that Seymour isn&apos;t her birth son.

[ Arnie Pye ] Arnie Pye, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, is a disgruntled, somewhat eccentric helicopter traffic reporter for Springfield&apos;s KBBL-TV (Channel 6). His name and appearance are a parody of the famous, Pulitzer winning 1930s journalist, Ernie Pyle. His segments are titled &quot; Arnie (or &quot; Pye &quot; ) in the Sky &quot;. He has an apparent dislike of anchorman Kent Brockman, with whom he often gets into arguments on the air, and Brockman once snarled that Arnie was a &quot; jackass &quot;.

[ Arthur Crandall and Gabbo ] Arthur Crandall and Gabbo (both voiced by Hank Azaria ) are a puppet and ventriloquist who start their own TV show that is in competition with Krusty the Clown &apos;s. The show is a huge hit that ruins Krusty&apos;s career, but Bart then ruins Gabbo&apos;s future by capturing him making a rude comment on TV. The pair are later reduced to low-paying work such as a show at an Indian casino. The pair mainly appeared in season four&apos;s &quot; Krusty Gets Kancelled &quot; but they also appeared in &quot; Bart to the Future &quot;, &quot; Homerazzi &quot;, &quot; All About Lisa &quot;, and The Simpsons Movie.

He makes his first appearance in &quot; Sweet Seymour Skinner&apos;s Baadasssss Song &quot;, where Lisa refers to Baby Gerald as Maggie&apos;s rival. On a few occasions, Gerald has been shown being pushed in a stroller by his mother outside the Simpson house as in &quot; Lady Bouvier&apos;s Lover &quot;, as the two babies glare at one another. The character&apos;s name was revealed in the episode &quot; The Canine Mutiny &quot;. { Richmond, p. 223 } [ Benjamin, Doug and Gary ] Benjamin, Doug, and Gary (voiced by Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria, and Dan Castellaneta, respectively) are geek s that were once Homer&apos;s dormitory roommates at Springfield University.

Marty is middle-aged and balding, while Bill is younger and has a full head of hair. They are responsible for giving Bart his elephant, Stampy, although they were surprised when Bart wanted Stampy, because they thought he would choose the other prize, $10,000. When Mr. Burns monopolized the local media in Fraudcast News, he fired the duo, but they have returned to the job in later episodes. [ Billy ] Billy is Troy McClure &apos;s assistant who appeared in &quot; Lisa the Simpson &quot;, and &quot; Bart the Mother &quot;. He was supposed to appear in more episodes but due to McClure&apos;s voice actor Phil Hartman &apos;s death, he was retired along with McClure. He is a child who appears in Troy McClure&apos;s educational films. He appears in the films &quot; Birds: Our Fine Feathered Colleagues &quot;, and &quot; In The Kitchen with DNA &quot;. He was voiced by Tress MacNeille.

[ Birch Barlow ] Birchibald &quot; Birch &quot; T. Barlow (voiced by Harry Shearer on &quot; Sideshow Bob Roberts &quot; and Maurice LaMarche on &quot; You Kent Always Say What You Want &quot; ). He is a conservative talk show host on the radio station KBBL, who in voice and appearance is modeled after Rush Limbaugh. As of &quot; You Kent Always Say What You Want &quot;, he also has a show on Fox News, and serves as a parody of Fox News conservative bias. On his radio show, he declares himself to be &quot; the fourth branch of government &quot; and &quot; the fifty-first state &quot;. He is also the author of the book Only Turkey s Have Left Wings. Barlow plays an important part in the episode &quot; Sideshow Bob Roberts &quot;, in which Sideshow Bob, while jailed, calls Barlow on his radio show, giving Bob an outlet to voice how the prison treats him unfairly. Barlow, knowing Bob is a fellow Republican, sympathizes with his complaints, and influences the rest of Springfield to as well. This leads to Bob&apos;s prompt release and ensuing mayor al election-rigging. Barlow also appears in the episode &quot; We&apos;re on the Road to D&apos;ohwhere &quot; as a customer at Marge&apos;s prescription drug-laden &quot; yard sale &quot;, a reference to Limbaugh&apos;s Oxycontin addiction. Most recently Barlow appears with other Springfield Republicans in the episode &quot; E Pluribus Wiggum &quot;, in which he tells Lisa to make Ralph Wiggum decide whether he wants to run for President as a Republican or a Democrat.

His significant roles were in the episodes &quot; Moaning Lisa &quot; and &quot; &apos;Round Springfield &quot;, though he appears in other episodes, such as &quot; Bart the Daredevil &quot; (where he is yellow), &quot; Dancin&apos; Homer &quot;, &quot; Old Money &quot;, &quot; Flaming Moe&apos;s, &quot; Bart Gets an F &quot;, &quot; Radio Bart &quot;, and &quot; Lisa&apos;s Pony &quot;.

When Lisa returns, she finds out that Bleeding Gums has died from circumstances which are never revealed. No one, except for Lisa, attends Murphy&apos;s funeral. Lisa soon learns that though he may be gone, he still is alive in her. It is strongly hinted that Murphy and Doctor Hibbert are long-lost brothers, most notably by Murphy&apos;s quote: &quot; I don&apos;t really have a family. All I had was a little brother who grew up to become a doctor. He used to laugh at the most inappropriate times. &quot; Hibbert then laughs inappropriately and says, &quot; Hey, I&apos;ve got an older brother that I&apos;ll never see. He&apos;s a jazz musician or some such. Oh well, bye, bye. &quot; Bleeding Gums Murphy is loosely based on Blind Willie Johnson, at whose feet the young Bleeding Gums character learned. { Matt Groening, DVD commentary for the episode &quot; &apos;Round Springfield &quot; } The voice of Bleeding Gums Murphy was provided by Ron Taylor, while his saxophone playing is provided by Dan Higgins. { Dan Higgins Biography Dan Higgins.net.

Originally, even after his death, Bart would skateboard past him on the street.In &quot; The Great Wife Hope &quot; Bleeding Gums Murphy is mentioned and supposedly according to Carl he is still alive after Homer asks Carl if he knows African-American boxer Drederick Tatum; Carl takes offense, saying that just because he is African American, he doesn&apos;t know all the other African-American citizens in Springfield. Carl then says that he met Drederick Tatum while he was at a party with Dr. Hibbert at Bleeding Gums Murphy&apos;s house. { Opening Sequence SNPP. } [ Blinky ] Blinky is a three-eyed orange fish featured primarily in &quot; Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish &quot;. Likely mutated by toxic waste from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant pouring into the river, Blinky became a major news story when he was caught by Bart Simpson. Mr. Burns defends the fish, arguing that his extra eye is merely the next step in evolution. Mr. Burns later goes to the Simpsons&apos; house for a meal to boost his race for governor. Marge, a supporter of Burns&apos; opponent Mary Bailey, deliberately serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns spits the fish out and subsequently loses the election. Blinky was briefly seen again in episodes &quot; Homer&apos;s Odyssey &quot; and &quot; Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in &quot; The Curse of the Flying Hellfish &quot; &quot;. Blinky also made a brief appearance in an underwater section of tube-way Fry travels through in the pilot episode of the animated series Futurama, which was created by Simpsons creator Matt Groening. [ Blue Haired Lawyer ] Mr. Burns&apos; Lawyer, { Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { Bart Gets Hit by a Car &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } also known as &quot; The Blue-Haired Lawyer &quot;, is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. { Gimple, p. 86 } He first appeared in the second season episode &quot; Bart Gets Hit by a Car &quot;. { Richmond, p. 153 } He is Springfield&apos;s most prominent and powerful lawyer, known for his blue hair and nasal New York accent. He also occasionally appears to serve as a prosecutor. Unlike Lionel Hutz or Gil Gunderson, he is a competent though not necessarily ethical lawyer. He has served as Mr. Burns &apos; head lawyer, helping him out with threats of the Power Plant closing down and of Burns losing his money. He is a member of the Springfield Republican Party. His clients often tend to be antagonists of the Simpsons. The Blue Haired Lawyer played a very important role in Bart&apos;s emancipation in &quot; Barting Over &quot; and works at a law firm named &quot; Luvum and Burnam &quot;. The character&apos;s demeanor, as well as Dan Castellaneta&apos;s voice for the character, are based on Roy Cohn, best known as Joe McCarthy &apos;s chief counsel during the Communist witchhunts in the 1950s. Animator Jim Reardon modeled the character&apos;s appearance on actor Charles Lane. { Reardon, Jim (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { Bart the Fink &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Boobarella ] Boobarella is an ample-chested vampire -looking woman, first seen in the episode &quot; I&apos;m Spelling as Fast as I Can &quot;. She is aware of the size of her breasts, and often makes reference to them on the rare occasion she appears on TV. Her character is a takeoff of Elvira, a character portrayed by Cassandra Peterson, herself a takeoff of Vampira. Her name is probably a takeoff from Vampirella and the 1968 cult science fiction/fantasy/horror film Barbarella, which stars Jane Fonda in the title role. Boobarella uses a stereotypical Eastern European &quot; horror &quot; accent and makes school supplies. [ Brandine Spuckler ] Brandine Spuckler is voiced by Tress MacNeille and is the partner of Cletus Spuckler. Brandine and Cletus are depicted as stereotypical yokels. Throughout the series, the two are shown to be brother and sister, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Alone Again, Natura-Diddily &quot; } boyfriend and girlfriend, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { There&apos;s Something About Marrying &quot; } mother and son, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { The Italian Bob &quot; } and father and daughter. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Little Big Girl &quot; } She is apparently the daughter of Cletus and an alien. She has suffered from rabies, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Goo Goo Gai Pan &quot; } and admitted to being illiterate. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot; } More recently, Brandine is shown fighting in the Iraq War. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Yokel Chords &quot; } She comes back revealing Cletus is the father of only two of the kids, casting doubt over the paternity of her other children. Assuming that all of the children believed to be Cletus&apos; are also hers, Brandine has 45 specifically named children. Brandine and Cletus were married by Homer during his brief stint as a priest. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Simple Simpson &quot; } On April 27, 2008, more is revealed about Cletus and Brandine in an episode entitled &quot; Apocalypse Cow &quot;; Brandine had married Cletus at the age of 13, and had married four times before that. Some of the most distinct features of Brandine are that she speaks in a thick accent, and wears her red hair up in a high ponytail. [ Brunella Pommelhorst ] The school gym teacher, voiced by Tress MacNeille / Maggie Roswell (in Moaning Lisa) First appeared in &quot; Moaning Lisa &quot;, although her name is not mentioned until &quot; The PTA Disbands &quot;. She has blond hair and usually wears a whistle and takes a tough-as-nails approach to teaching. In &quot; Little Girl in the Big Ten &quot;, she decides that because of the oath she took on Xena, she has to fail Lisa but decides to let her make it up by taking private lessons. In a more recent episode, &quot; My Fair Laddy &quot;, she decides to leave for the year and return the next semester as &quot; Mr. Pommelhorst, the new shop teacher. &quot; [ Bumblebee Man ] The Bumblebee Man, voiced by Hank Azaria, is the star of a Spanish-language television sitcom on &quot; Channel Ocho &quot;, in which he dresses in a bumblebee costume and performs slapstick comedy. In the episode &quot; Team Homer &quot;, his bowling shirt bears the name &quot; Pedro &quot;. He works at the same studio as Kent Brockman. His first appearance was in &quot; Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie &quot;. Bumblebee Man is never seen to take off his costume, even when by himself; the sole exception is the episode &quot; 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot;, in which his private life is shown. In this short segment, he is portrayed as innately clumsy rather than simply acting as such. In general, Bumblebee Man only speaks in simple, over-enunciated (and inaccurate) Spanish sentences. His catchphrases of choice are typically &quot; ¡Ay, ay, ay, no me gusta! &quot; ( &quot; I don&apos;t like it! &quot; ), &quot; ¡Ay, ay, ay, no es bueno! &quot; ( &quot; That&apos;s not good! &quot; ) and &quot; ¡Ay, Dios no me ama! &quot; ( &quot; God doesn&apos;t love me! &quot; ). Quite commonly, his phrases will be intentionally sloppy Spanish. For example, in the episode &quot; 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot;, there are several words used that are not real (such as &quot; wudpequero &quot; for &quot; woodpecker &quot;, rather than the correct pájaro carpintero). The crude Spanish is used so that English-speaking viewers would still understand what was being said. { Season 7 DVD Commentary - &quot; } { 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot; } On occasions, he also speaks English, such as briefly in &quot; Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington &quot;. In &quot; Bart Gets Famous &quot;, he anchored the news with an articulate English accent, filling in for the regular, Kent Brockman. Bumblebee Man is a caricature of El Chapulín Colorado, a character created and portrayed by Mexican television comedian Roberto Gómez Bolaños (a.k.a. &quot; Chespirito &quot; ), and his show consists of simple skits, often involving heavy slapstick. The staff have said that whenever they watched Telemundo, this character was &quot; always on &quot;, thus they created Bumblebee Man, who is also always on the air when the Spanish-language channel is depicted. [ Reiss, Mike 2004 The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] His costume was based on one used in the Saturday Night Live sketch &quot; Killer Bees &quot;. [ Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves 2007-08-15 2000-10-21 TV Guide Joe Rhodes ] Hank Azaria won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Bumblebee Man, and various other characters, in 2003. [ http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search Emmys.org 2008-11-05 ] [ Capital City Goofball ] The Capital City Goofball is the mascot for Capital City. He was voiced by Tom Poston. His appearance seems to have been inspired by the mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, the Phillie Phanatic. The costume is a creature with a baseball body, with a blue Capital City T-Shirt, yellow arms and legs, a long flat-ended nose, tufts of fur at the side, a red hat with two springs, two costume eyes that look in either direction, and two more eyes that peek outside the mouth. The Capital City Goofball first appeared in the episode &quot; Dancin&apos; Homer &quot; and shared the stage with Homer. In &quot; Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade &quot;, the Capital City Goofball represents Capital City in the state legislature; he spent 80 million dollars out of his own pocket to win the seat, and now is leading an effort to change the state&apos;s embarrassing, Confederate-symbol centered state flag. With the death of Tom Poston in 2007, it is likely that this character will be retired, if the precedent regarding Phil Hartman and Doris Grau &apos;s characters (except for Lunchlady Doris, who is still used and is now voiced by Tress MacNeille ) is followed. He has not spoken since &quot; Bart and Lisa vs. the Third Grade &quot; and has been reduced to making minor background appearances and usual honking sounds. [ Captain Lance Murdock ] Captain Lance Murdock is a professional stunt devil who appeared more in the early days of the show rather than the newer episodes. He first appeared in &quot; Bart the Daredevil &quot; which featured him in more scenes than other episodes. He later appeared in &quot; I Married Marge &quot;, &quot; Selma&apos;s Choice &quot;, and &quot; Viva Ned Flanders &quot;. He was most recently featured when Krusty was flicking channels on his TV in &quot; Today I Am a Clown &quot;. He also appears in Lisa &apos;s lecture about Lake Springfield in The Simpsons Movie sitting in the audience. His signature bike is the suicycle and has his own action figure complete with ambulance. [ Charlie ] Charlie, voiced by Dan Castellaneta works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as the &apos;Dangerous Emissions Supervisor&apos;. He was briefly replaced by Mindy Simmons, but she got fired afterwards. His first appearance was in &quot; Life on the Fast Lane &quot;. He was briefly out of work due to a unnamed on-the-job injury, where he collected workers&apos; compensation, however future episodes show him back to work. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { King-Size Homer &quot; } { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer Goes to College &quot; } He has a wife and two kids { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer the Smithers &quot; } as well as a sister with a wooden leg. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer at the Bat &quot; } In &quot; The Trouble with Trillions &quot;, Charlie tells Homer (who is working undercover) that he has plans to overrun the American government due to their stalling on making HDTV available; he is soon arrested by FBI agents for conspiracy. Dan Castellaneta said that he did &quot; an imitation of Lenny &quot; (voiced by Harry Shearer ) for the voice. { Castellaneta, Dan (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { Homer at the Bat &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Chase/Pyro ] Chase, also known as Pyro, is an American Gladiator. He is a parody of the real-life Gladiator Nitro. He first appears in the episode &quot; A Milhouse Divided &quot;, when he is dating Luann after she divorces Kirk. Their relationship ends when she&apos;s caught cheating on him with his best friend Gyro. He also appears in &quot; Wild Barts Can&apos;t Be Broken &quot;, &quot; Mom and Pop Art &quot;, &quot; Alone Again, Natura-Diddily &quot;, It&apos;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge, Day of the Jackanapes, A Star Is Born Again, and &quot; The Bart of War &quot;. He is voiced by Hank Azaria. [ Cookie Kwan ] Cookie Kwan (voiced by Tress MacNeille ), is an Asian American real estate broker who first appears in the Season 9 Simpsons episode &quot; Realty Bites &quot;. She is the stereotypical competitive woman. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Realty Bites &quot; } She touts herself as being &quot; number one on the West Side &quot;, although she also works on the East Side. She is very aggressive toward anyone whom she deems a threat to her business, evidenced by when she threatens Gil Gunderson. She had once attempted to seduce Ned Flanders, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { A Star Is Born-Again &quot; } had an illegitimate baby with Mayor Quimby, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { She Used to Be My Girl &quot; } and flirted with Homer. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Large Marge &quot; } She is friends with Lindsey Naegle. She is a Republican. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { You Kent Always Say What You Want &quot; } She is played by MacNeille with a strong and harsh Asian accent. [ Corporal Punishment ] Corporal Punishment is a cast member on the Krusty the Clown show. He first appeared in the episode Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge as the enforcer for the show. He is a large man and is always seen in military uniform. [ Crazy Cat Lady ] Eleanor Abernathy { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { See Homer Run &quot; } (voiced by Tress MacNeille ), better known as the Crazy Cat Lady, is a woman with the appearance and behavior of a stereotypical mentally ill person. She first appears in &quot; Girly Edition &quot;. Abernathy is always surrounded by a large number of cats, and in every appearance she screams gibberish and/or throws cats at passersby. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Girly Edition. &quot; } She gives Lisa one of her cats, Snowball V, who looks exactly like her original Snowball II. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot &quot; } Abernathy has an unfortunate past. When she was eight, she was a smart and ambitious young girl who wanted to be both a lawyer and a doctor &quot; because a woman can do anything &quot;. She was studying for law school at 16, and by 24 she had earned a law degree from Yale Law School and a medical degree from Harvard Medical School. However, by 32, suffering from burnout, she had turned to alcohol and became obsessed with her pet cat. By the time she turned 40, she had assumed her present state as a drunken, raving lunatic. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Springfield Up &quot; } Abernathy briefly reverts to her sanity and high intelligence thanks to some pills that she shows the Simpsons, but after Marge points out that the pills are actually Reese&apos;s Pieces candy, Abernathy abruptly resumes her deranged behavior. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer and Ned&apos;s Hail Mary Pass &quot; } When participating in a mayoral election, she lucidly discusses topics such as health care, economy and public education in between her screams and gibberish. In the episode &quot; Eeny Teeny Maya Moe, &quot; Abernathy reveals that she once owned a cat with Moe Syzlak after he says that there &quot; Is a much creepier guy right next to me. &quot; from a public library computer. She yells &quot; You know I&apos;m a woman! &quot; and also that their cat had kittens; she then proclaims that &quot; These are yours! &quot; and insanely throws three cats at him.In the episode &quot; A Midsummer&apos;s Nice Dream, &quot; Abernathy is shown to be a hoarder. After Marge helps her clean up her house, she begins speaking normally and wearing proper clothing. Later, in an attempt to fix Marge&apos;s new hoarding problem, Abernathy reverts back to her crazy self, reclaiming all of the hoarded junk and calling her cats back to her. { &apos;&apos;The Simpsons episode &quot; } { A Midsummer&apos;s Nice Dream &quot; } [ Crusher and Lowblow ] Crusher (also referred to as Joey) and Lowblow are a pair of stereotypical henchmen often found in the employment of Montgomery Burns as he prefers the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons. Crusher&apos;s first appearance was in the second season episode &quot; Blood Feud &quot; where he is seen escorting Homer off the premises of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The two seem to be on first name terms as Homer calls him Joey. Their first appearance together was in the episode &quot; Last Exit to Springfield &quot; when the two of them kidnap Homer and take him to Burns Manor. They introduce themselves as &apos;Hired Goons&apos;, a term that Homer apparently is not familiar with. The pair rarely had speaking roles and were often used as Mr Burns&apos; goons for a number of early episodes but eventually they became background characters. [ Database ] Database, or Data, (real name unknown to viewers) is a nerd y student who attends Springfield Elementary School. He first appeared in the episode &quot; Bart&apos;s Comet &quot; as a member of &quot; the Super Friends &quot;. He has since had speaking parts in several episodes. He is usually seen with his fellow nerd Martin Prince. Database is a common target for Nelson, Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney. Database is part of the group of boys who invade Shelbyville in &quot; Lemon of Troy &quot;. He is one of the Pre-Teen Braves in the episode &quot; The Bart of War &quot;. He is a member of the school band, as seen in &quot; The PTA Disbands &quot;. Database is known for his annoying, nerdy voice which is supplied by Nancy Cartwright. Database&apos;s father is shown in &quot; Lemon of Troy &quot;, although he utters no dialogue and is only in the background and has not appeared since that episode. Matt Groening has stated that Database is his least favorite character in the show. { Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { Lemon of Troy &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season (DVD). 20th Century Fox. } [ Dave Shutton ] Dave Shutton, voiced by Harry Shearer, is a reporter for The Springfield Shopper. Writer John Swartzwelder named Shutton after a friend of his. { Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } His first appearance was in the season two episode &quot; Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish. &quot; Since then, his roles have become less relevant and have been reduced to cameos and appearances in crowd scenes. According to &quot; Who Shot Mr. Burns &quot;, Part 2, Kent Brockman does not like Dave Shutton and thinks he is unprofessional. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Who Shot Mr. Burns?

Growing Up Springfield is his most notable documentary. It follows the lives of the inhabitants of Springfield, starting when they were in third grade and continuing every eight years. It is a parody of Michael Apted ’s Up Series. Desmond appeared in the episodes &quot; &apos;Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky &quot; and &quot; Fat Man And Little Boy &quot; and his Growing Up Springfield series were featured in the episode &quot; Springfield Up &quot;. The character is based on real British filmmakers David Attenborough and Desmond Morris [ January 2009 ]. [ Dewey Largo ] Dewey Largo, voiced by Harry Shearer, is the music teacher, whom Lisa credited with proving that any piece of music could have the soul sucked out of it. He is very uncreative and is a poor, pathetic music conductor. He is always seen in the opening sequence, teaching his class and throwing Lisa out of his band class when she plays a funky/jazzy tune on her saxophone. His last name Largo is also an Italian word for a slow, broad musical tempo, a possible reference to the fact that he can make any piece of music uninteresting. He has not played a large role in the series, but was originally intended to be an uptight foil for Lisa, and her non-conformist ways. After the first few seasons, Mr. Largo was rarely seen. However he has since resurfaced as a recurring character in the seventeenth season, making appearances in several episodes. In the 17th season in the episode &quot; Homer&apos;s Paternity Coot &quot; it is revealed that Largo was accepted to the Juilliard School, but never got the letter as it was frozen atop Mount Springfield. He ended up at Springfield Elementary instead. A recurring gag since the 17th season episode &quot; See Homer Run &quot;, are allusions that Largo is gay. The 22nd season episode &quot; Flaming Moe &quot; confirmed Largo is gay and in a relationship with an older man. [ Disco Stu ] Disco Stu, real name Stuart Discotheque { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Homer Scissorhands &quot; } (voiced by Hank Azaria ) is a man who is mentally stuck in the disco era. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Two Bad Neighbors &quot; } He is normally featured wearing a rhinestone-encrusted leisure suit. Stu was introduced as the punchline to a joke in &quot; Two Bad Neighbors &quot;. In a garage sale, Homer attempts to sell a jacket on which he had once tried to write &quot; Disco Stud &quot; in rhinestone s, but having made the letters too big he did not have room for the final &quot; d &quot;. After Marge remarks that nobody would ever want to buy a jacket that read &quot; Disco Stu &quot;, another customer recommends it to Stu, but Stu replies, &quot; Disco Stu doesn&apos;t advertise. &quot; Stu&apos;s speech pattern is similar to that of Duffman, also voiced by Hank Azaria; he speaks in the third person, often referring to himself as &quot; Disco Stu &quot; (emphasizing &quot; Stu &quot; and then pausing before saying anything else; whatever follows usually rhymes with &quot; Stu &quot; ). According to &quot; How I Spent My Strummer Vacation &quot;, Stu actually is aware disco is dead, does not like disco music at all, and worries that his personality may make him a &quot; one-note guy &quot;. He is a Roman Catholic, having gotten an annulment from Pope John Paul II after a brief marriage to Selma Bouvier. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { How I Spent My Strummer Vacation &quot; } { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { How I Wet Your Mother &quot; } In the March 11th, 2012 episode &quot; How I Wet Your Mother &quot;, Professor Frink created a device that allowed people to enter the dreams of others. He stated he had already used the device &quot; To cure another Springfielder of his particular obsession &quot; at which point Stu walked into the frame in khakis and a collared shirt saying &quot; Normal Stu likes normal things. &quot; It is yet to be seen whether this transformation is permanent. Stu was originally to be voiced by repeat guest star Phil Hartman. However, when the animators remodeled the character, show runner Bill Oakley described the original Disco Stu as &quot; a black, wrinkly John Travolta &quot;, and Hartman was not available to dub the voice; Hank Azaria took over the role. { Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { Two Bad Neighbors &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Out of 25, IGN named Stu the 24th top peripheral character in The Simpsons.

He has light blue skin and wears a white laboratory coat, gloves and goggles. Doctor Colossus is a minor character and usually only appears in the background. He lives on &quot; Death Mountain &quot;. Doctor Colossus is often shown in jail, hinting that he is very incompetent as a supervillain. [ Dolph Starbeam ] Dolphin &quot; Dolph &quot; Starbeam, voiced by Tress MacNeille, is a bully and student at Springfield Elementary School. Dolph is recognized by his asymmetrical haircut which covers one eye and wears cutoff shorts and basketball shoes. He is left-handed and does not talk as much as the other bullies. He usually comes across as very intelligent and speaks a variety of languages including Esperanto, Swahili, and Klingon. It turns out Dolph is Jewish and attends Hebrew school. Despite the fact that he appears to be wholly Caucasian, in the episode &quot; Little Big Girl &quot; he shows up to multicultural day with a disked lower lip, suggesting some African or South American descent. He lied to his friends about not having a bar mitzvah, later claiming it had been &quot; just family &quot;. He has also mentioned the fact that he has two fathers. Dolph was named after one of Matt Groening&apos;s classmates from Lincoln High School named Dolph Timmerman. Groening stated that Timmerman was not a bully but just a real cool guy. [ Drederick Tatum ] Drederick Tatum (voiced by Hank Azaria ) has appeared in several episodes. He is a professional boxer and the reigning World Heavyweight Champion. He features prominently in the episode &quot; The Homer They Fall &quot;, in which Homer takes up boxing and is lined up as an opponent for Tatum, soon to be released from prison. The fight proves one-sided, and Homer is rescued by Moe just as he is about to be knocked out by Tatum. Tatum grew up in Springfield, but in &quot; Flaming Moe&apos;s &quot; he calls the city &quot; a dump &quot; and says &quot; if you ever see me back there, you know I really fu*#ed up bad! &quot; A former 1984 Olympic Gold medalist, he first became champion after defeating Watson in the heavily promoted &quot; Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out! &quot;, a fight Homer and his friends watched on his illegal cable hookup. He was so feared inside prison he could stop riots just by telling the rioters to shut up. Tatum also appears in &quot; Bye Bye Nerdie &quot;. Lisa tests her nerd spray on him, which forces Nelson Muntz to involuntarily get up and start punching Tatum, to little effect. A sobbing Nelson tries to apologise but Tatum rolls up his sleeves and declares &quot; you leave me little recourse! &quot; Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson, with a high-pitched lisping voice, a menacing demeanor, a criminal record, financial problems and a tendency to make pseudo-intellectual comments like &quot; I insist that you desist &quot; and &quot; your behavior is unconscionable &quot;. He also has an unscrupulous manager named Lucius Sweet, who closely resembles Tyson&apos;s promoter/manager Don King. Indeed, in &quot; The Homer They Fall &quot; Homer notes that Sweet &quot; is as rich and famous as Don King, and looks just like him &quot;. King and Tyson were asked to appear in the episode but declined. Paul Winfield, who played King in a 1995 Tyson biopic, took the role instead. [ Duffman ] Duffman, voiced by Hank Azaria, is a recurring character, who according to Turner, &quot; embodies all the self-importance and over-statement of contemporary marketing. &quot; [ Turner 2004 172 ] He is the mascot for the fictional Duff Corporation that sells Duff beer, [ Cochran Jennifer D. &quot; Mmmm...

Duffman is a muscular actor, dressed in a superhero costume who spouts slogans while he thrusts his hips. Duffman&apos;s thrusts were first acted out by Brad Bird. { Mentioned in the } { audio commentary for &quot; } { The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson &quot;. } His catchphrase comes from the song &quot; Oh Yeah &quot; by Yello, which the producers say became extremely popular after Ferris Bueller&apos;s Day Off and many advertisers started using it. As a result, the writers felt that the song and phrase &quot; Oh yeah! &quot; would be suitable for the character. [ Oakley, Bill 2006 Commentary for &quot; The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson &quot;. The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season DVD 20th Century Fox ] While usually loyal to his corporate sponsors, in the season 15 episode &quot; Co-Dependent&apos;s Day &quot;, Duffman reveals he is ashamed of betraying his Jew ish heritage by doing a Nazi-esque performance at Oktoberfest ( &quot; This reich will last a thousand beers! Oh, ja! [muttering]: I do this, and I&apos;m Jewish. &quot; ). In the season 17 episode &quot; Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play &quot;, it was revealed that there were two more Duffmen working.

Miss Hoover has been worn down by her years in the public school system, and in Lisa Gets an &quot; A &quot; implies that she frequently drinks during lunch. In the episode Lisa&apos;s Substitute, she thought she had lyme disease. She is very apathetic and bored with her job, and seems overwhelmed with stress, seeking whatever remedies she can to alleviate it. She is often seen smoking even while teaching, once even under a &quot; No Smoking &quot; sign in the assembly hall. Her desperate attempts to regain her stability include rushing out of class to recite &quot; Calm blue ocean, calm blue ocean &quot; with her eyes closed, getting into her car and driving off on two occasions, and even letting Ralph teach the class when she was granted tenure. When the series began Miss Hoover&apos;s hair was pale blue, but from Season 4 onwards, she has had brown hair, presumably because of stress. [ March 2012 ] [ Fallout Boy ] In the series, Fallout Boy first appears in a 1950s Radioactive Man serial film shown at a comic book convention in the episode &quot; Three Men and a Comic Book. &quot; However, unlike many Simpsons characters, he has only made a handful of appearances since. While Radioactive Man is a broad parody of many superheroes, most obviously containing elements of Batman and Superman (and the comic incorporates an origin story similar to Marvel &apos;s Hulk ), among others, Fallout Boy is mainly a parody of Robin (with his costume, references as being the &apos;young ward&apos; of Radioactive Man, and his younger age and sidekick status) with elements of Spider-Man (his fictional comic book origin, for example). His catchphrase is &quot; Jiminy Jillickers! &quot; Additionally, Fallout Boy also appears in a real-life comic book titled Radioactive Man, published by Bongo Comics (a comic created in part by Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons). In these comic books, Fallout Boy&apos;s real name is Rod Runtledge, he has a brother named Dodd Runtledge, and they live in Zenith City. Rod is a high school nerd living with his aunt, Aunt June. Fallout Boy was an average book worm, until one day, he was at a Radioactive demonstration, where he met up with Claude Kane. A tall piece of machinery fell towards them. Claude grabbed Rod and jumped over the rail, Claude holding onto the machine. The machine came to life, and as the ray passed through Claude, who became Radioactive Man, it hit Rod. Rod then got a pint sized version of RM&apos;s powers, and became Fallout Boy. In the episode &quot; Radioactive Man &quot;, Milhouse was chosen over Bart to play Fallout Boy in the Radioactive Man movie to be filmed in Springfield. Rock band Fall Out Boy took the name of this character after, when they asked a concert audience what band name they should have, a fan shouted &quot; Fallout Boy! &quot; [ Frankie the Squealer ] Frankie the Squealer is a member of the Mafia and associate of Fat Tony. However, he does not appear to be very useful to his colleagues in criminal activity due to his uncontrollable habit of squealing (he claims that &quot; it makes [him] feel big &quot; ), even squealing on himself one time. On several occasions, the mob has attempted to kill him for his squealing, though they have repeatedly been unsuccessful. Frankie first appeared in episode &quot; Insane Clown Poppy &quot; where his squealing habits are introduced after he squeals on himself for squealing. [ Gil Gunderson ] Gil Gunderson, a.k.a. Ol&apos; Gil, voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared in the ninth season episode &quot; Realty Bites &quot; as a real estate agent with Lionel Hutz &apos;s Red Blazer Realty. { Scully, Mike (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { Realty Bites &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } He is a spoof of actor Jack Lemmon &apos;s portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 film adaptation of the play Glengarry Glen Ross. (Lemmon himself voiced a character similar to Levene in the eighth season episode &quot; The Twisted World of Marge Simpson &quot;.) { Weinstein, Josh (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { The Twisted World of Marge Simpson &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Show runner Mike Scully said that the writers thought that Gil would be &quot; a one-shot thing &quot;. { Scully, Mike (2006). He is seen working many different jobs in multiple epsisodes. Commentary for &quot; } { Natural Born Kissers &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } &quot; Dan Castellaneta was so funny at the table read doing the character &quot;, Scully elaborated, &quot; we kept making up excuses in subsequent episodes to put him in. &quot; Writer Dan Greaney said that it was a great take-off on Levene to make Gil more desperate than he was. Even so, the writers like to write Gil with &quot; a little bit of the old sparkle &quot; left in him. { Greaney, Dan (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { Realty Bites &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } With the retirement of the character Lionel Hutz (after voice actor Phil Hartman &apos;s death), Gil has been working as the Simpson&apos;s lawyer in later episodes. In 2006, &quot; Kill Gil, Volumes I &amp; II &quot;, the only episode to center on Gil, won a Writers Guild of America Award in the animation category. [ http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id%3D2764 2008 Writers Guild Awards Winners Announced -- 2008-02-09 WGAW ] [ Gloria ] Gloria, voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus is Snake &apos;s girlfriend. She is a meter maid. She first appears in &quot; A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love &quot;, dating Mr. Burns. She ends up leaving him to return to her ex-boyfriend Snake, for criticising but unintendedly complementing him in the same sentence. Gloria visits Snake in prison in &quot; I Don&apos;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. &quot; She appears once again in &quot; Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes &quot;, where she is now pregnant. However in &quot; Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words &quot; they have broken up. Then, in &quot; Wedding For Disaster &quot; they seem to have gotten back together and apparently got married. [ God ] God, voiced by Harry Shearer, has had many appearances in the series, including &quot; Homer the Heretic &quot;, &quot; Thank God, It&apos;s Doomsday &quot;, and a scene with Him, Buddha, and Colonel Sanders in &quot; Pray Anything &quot;, as well as appearing in the flick across the town in the opening sequence (in the HD episodes) where he is fighting with the devil. He is portrayed in the traditional depiction of the Abrahamic God : a gray-haired man in a white robe with a booming voice. In most episodes, only his beard is seen as the camera only films him up to the shoulders. His body is usually surrounded by a glowing light, and his robes float around him, though not always. He does not seem to be all-knowing. Another notable characteristic of him is his ability to forgive and tolerate Homer&apos;s mishaps, despite his later often heretical attitude. He is on good and even friendly terms with Homer, but he would not hesitate to severely punish him if Homer become too obnoxious. One of God&apos;s distinctive features is that he and Jesus are the only two Simpsons characters to be drawn with five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot, though not always. [ Grady and Julio ] Grady, voiced by Scott Thompson and Julio, voiced by Hank Azaria are two gay men who become Homer&apos;s roommates when he leaves Marge in &quot; Three Gays of the Condo &quot;. Julio reappears in &quot; There&apos;s Something About Marrying &quot;, marrying another man, in &quot; I Don&apos;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings &quot; as one of the bank robbery hostages, and has speaking cameos in &quot; Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind &quot; and &quot; E Pluribus Wiggum &quot;. He appeared in the episode &quot; Four Great Women and a Manicure &quot;, in which he was seen as &quot; King Julio &quot; in Lisa&apos;s first story, &quot; Elizabeth the First &quot;. He works as a photographer, as seen in &quot; The Devil Wears Nada &quot;. Grady made his second appearance to date in &quot; Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words &quot;, in which he persuades Homer to break up his (Grady&apos;s) relationship with Julio, so that he could pursue a relationship with Duffman. Julio made further appearances as Marge&apos;s Hairdresser in &quot; The Blue and the Gray &quot; and &quot; Homer Scissorhands &quot;. [ Gunter and Ernst ] Gunter and Ernst, Las Vegas-style entertainers voiced by Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria, are obvious parodies of Siegfried &amp; Roy : they speak with German accents, their act involves magic and white tiger s, and one has black hair while the other has bleached-blond hair. The duo appear in the episodes &quot; Viva Ned Flanders &quot;, &quot; $pringfield &quot;, &quot; The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons &quot;, and &quot; Jazzy and the Pussycats &quot;. In &quot; Jazzy and the Pussycats &quot;, they are seen at Amber Simpson&apos;s funeral. In &quot; The Simpsons Game &quot; it is revealed they performed at an aquarium. In a case of life imitating art, the 1993 episode &quot; $pringfield &quot; (the first episode featuring Gunter and Ernst) depicts the duo being savagely mauled by their trademark white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years later, the trained white tiger Montecore dragged Roy Horn off-stage by his neck during a performance at The Mirage. According to the DVD commentary on this episode on the Simpsons season five DVD set, the part where Gunter and Ernst get attacked is considered &quot; the greatest prediction &quot; the Simpsons ever made, but it was &quot; bound to happen &quot; considering how the tiger was treated. [ The Happy Little Elves ] The Happy Little Elves are a parody of The Smurfs, who appeared more often in the show&apos;s earlier episodes. They are a favorite of Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Bart, however, hates them; he mainly refers to them as either &quot; those stupid elves &quot; &quot; The Crappy Little Elves &quot;, or &quot; The Little Green Idiots &quot;. Their movies include Return of the Happy Little Elves, an unnamed Christmas movie as seen in &quot; Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire &quot;, The Happy Little Elves Meet The Curious Bear Cubs, The Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town, and The Happy Little Elves meet Fuzzy Snuggleduck (which was listed as an R-rated movie along with Thelma &amp; Louise and The Erotic Awakening of S on Rancho Relaxo&apos;s cable system). They were first mentioned in a short on The Tracey Ullman Show entitled &quot; Scary Movie &quot;. The most recent appearance they had was in &quot; Lisa Simpson, This Isn&apos;t Your Life &quot; in November 2010. In more current episodes, they appear as wall decorations in Maggie&apos;s and Lisa&apos;s rooms. [ Helen Lovejoy ] Helen Lovejoy (née Schwartzbaum), voiced by Maggie Roswell and Marcia Mitzman Gaven, is Rev. Lovejoy ’s judgmental and gossip y wife, and the mother of Jessica Lovejoy. She introduced herself in the episode &quot; Life on the Fast Lane &quot; as &quot; the gossipy wife of the minister. &quot; Her catchphrase is &quot; What about the children?! Won&apos;t somebody &apos;&apos;please&apos;&apos; think of the children !? &quot; which she always says among a crowd when something bad is happening in the city. In &quot; Wedding for Disaster &quot;, the Parson remarks to Reverend Lovejoy that he remembers when Helen Lovejoy was Helen Schwartzbaum and prior to that, Harold Schwartzbaum, before deciding he has said too much, implying that Helen was not always a woman, however this is directly contradicted as in flashbacks she is shown to be a girl as a child, and the fact that she and Reverend Lovejoy have a biological daughter in Jessica. In E Pluribus Wiggum, it was revealed that Helen is a member of the Springfield Republican Caucus while in one of their dungeon meetings. In the Treehouse of Horror XX, she is revealed to be Lisa&apos;s Godmother. [ Herman ] Herman Larson, voiced by Harry Shearer, is the owner of Herman&apos;s Military Antiques. He is a right-arm above-elbow amputee; he tells Bart that the arm was lost when he stuck it out the window of a moving bus as a kid. A brilliant military tactician, Herman was instrumental in Bart’s victory in water balloon combat against Nelson and in the negotiation of the peace treaty between the two combatants in &quot; Bart the General &quot;, which is his most significant and first appearance. He is friends with Abraham Simpson, to whom he sold a fez, claiming it was previously owned by Napoleon; Herman then advertised Abe&apos;s old hat as &quot; the hat McKinley was shot in &quot;. He also tried to sell counterfeit jeans out of the Simpsons&apos; garage, but was foiled by Marge Simpson. He once captured Chief Wiggum and Snake and held them hostage, but was accidentally knocked out by Milhouse with a medieval mace, rescuing them. Harry Shearer does an impression of George H.W. Bush for the voice. { Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { Bart the General &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Herman&apos;s facial appearance is modeled after Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder. The original idea behind Herman, said Groening, was that each time he appeared, he would give a different explanation for how he lost his arm. However, the second joke, involving Herman having stuck his arm in a ball return at a bowling alley, got cut, and the writers never pursued the idea. { Groening, Matt (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { Treehouse of Horror VIII &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Janey Powell ] Janey Powell, voiced by Pamela Hayden, is a classmate and friend of Lisa Simpson. Janey first appeared in &quot; Bart the General &quot; and was once Lisa&apos;s closest friend. She has been at Lisa&apos;s sleepover s, and Lisa is seen watching cartoons at her house on numerous occasions. Her description on The Simpsons POG set described her as &quot; Lisa&apos;s fair-weather friend &quot;. Though she is sometimes seen spending time with Lisa, other times she teases her along with the other children. She is not portrayed as being nearly as intelligent or nerdy as Lisa. Janey may have had a crush on Milhouse Van Houten, who has a crush on Lisa. She enjoys reading babysitting books. [ Jasper Beardly ] Jasper Beardly, voiced by Harry Shearer is one of the elder residents of Springfield, often portrayed as Abraham Simpson &apos;s best friend. His most distinguishing features are his ultra-low, gravelly voice and very long beard. Jasper made his first appearance in &quot; Homer&apos;s Odyssey &quot;. He is a veteran of World War II, but (according to the episode &quot; Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play &quot; ) he attempted to avoid the draft by disguising himself as a woman. He stayed in Springfield to play in the local women&apos;s baseball league, along with his friend Abe, who was also avoiding the war but was exposed during a game. In a deleted scene, it was shown that Jasper was the town pastor, prior to Reverend Lovejoy. He briefly served as substitute teacher of Lisa&apos;s class during which time he confiscated everything made of tin, got his beard caught in a pencil sharpener and threatened paddling for minor infractions such as looking out the window or talking out of turn. In the subplot of the season nine episode, &quot; Lisa the Simpson &quot;, Jasper put himself in crude &quot; suspended animation &quot; in the Kwik-E-Mart &apos;s freezer, and under advice from Dr. Nick Riviera, Apu kept him frozen. When Jasper&apos;s frozen form became popular with customers, Apu started exploiting the spectacle, and transformed the Kwik-E-Mart into a special interest store dealing with weird items, or perfectly ordinary ones which had been made out to be abnormal, called the Freak-E-Mart. Jasper was accidentally unfrozen, and stepped out into what he thought was a future world, just as Apu was considering selling him to the Rich Texan. In the episode &quot; I Don&apos;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings &quot; Jasper mentions he is a diabetic. [ Jebediah Springfield ] Jebediah Obadiah Zachariah Jedediah Springfield (a.k.a. Hans Sprungfeld) is the founder of the town of Springfield. He is voiced by Harry Shearer. According to legend, Jebediah Springfield and his partner Shelbyville Manhattan, led a band that left Maryland in search of &quot; New Sodom &quot; due to a misinterpretation of the Bible, but they parted ways over political differences: though both men are devoted to chastity and abstinence, Manhattan wanted to let people be free to marry their cousins if they wish, to which Springfield strongly opposes. It was then Manhattan went on to found the rival town of Shelbyville, taking half of the settlers with him. Springfield had many famous quotations, such as &quot; A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man &quot;. He also wears a coonskin cap. The Springfield Marathon commemorates an occasion on which he ran across six states in order to avoid his creditors. In &quot; The Telltale Head &quot; Bart beheaded the statue, thinking that this would make him more popular. In reality, the town became depressed and angry, leaving Bart to endure &quot; The Tell-Tale Heart &quot; -style guilt before replacing it. This episode is referenced in multiple Simpsons video games such as The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants, where the statue&apos;s head serves as a power-up item, or The Simpsons Road Rage and The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run, where characters can kick or ram Jebediah&apos;s head off the statue. Many Jebediah legends have been debunked during the run of the series. For instance, &quot; The Telltale Head &quot; repeatedly refers to Jebediah killing a bear with his bare hands, but on the news, Kent Brockman reveals that recent historical evidence suggests the bear actually killed Jebediah. On an expedition to Springfield&apos;s historic &quot; Fort Springfield &quot;, Bart uncovers other inconsistencies in the Jebediah legend, such as that he fought at Fort Ticonderoga the same day as the first Whacking Day. Most of Springfield&apos;s biography is revealed in the 1996 episode &quot; Lisa the Iconoclast &quot;, wherein Lisa Simpson discovers Jebediah Springfield&apos;s biggest secret: he was formerly a bloodthirsty pirate named Hans Sprungfeld, who once brawled with George Washington and lost after Washington crushed Sprungfeld&apos;s genitals in one of his sets of iron false teeth. Sprungfeld fled and changed his name in 1795 to hide his identity. He was well known for his &quot; silver tongue &quot; (literally; a metal prosthetic tongue, his original tongue having been bitten off by a Turkish pirate in a grog house fight). Before he died of diphtheria, he wrote his confession on a scrap of canvas that he hid in a fife. The canvas scrap formed the &quot; missing piece &quot; of the famously incomplete 1796 Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington; Sprungfeld picked it up during a fight against Washington which occurred while the latter was having his portrait painted. Lisa decides not to reveal this secret to the people of Springfield, seeing that the myth of Jebediah has brought out the good in everyone and that the true story will cause them to lose hope and morale within themselves. The Australian rock-band &quot; Jebediah &quot; was named after Jebediah Springfield. [ Jimbo Jones ] Corky James &quot; Jimbo &quot; Jones, voiced by Pamela Hayden and originally by Tress MacNeille in his first appearance in the first season episode &quot; The Telltale Head &quot; is a lowlife who wears a purple knit cap and a black T-shirt emblazoned with a menacing skull. He can often be seen hanging around Kearney, Dolph, and sometimes Nelson. He is generally acknowledged as the leader of this clique. He enjoys intimidating his schoolmates and shoplifting. It is hinted that he comes from a well-off family, most notably in season six&apos;s &quot; The PTA Disbands &quot; when  — with the school closed for a teacher&apos;s strike - he and his mother watch soap opera s and sip tea together in a very nice living room. In season seven&apos;s Bart the Fink, Bart discovers that Jimbo&apos;s real name is Corky. Jimbo&apos;s other known aliases are Jamesbo, Dr. J and Hector Gutierrez. Jimbo is named for executive producer James L. Brooks. { Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { The Telltale Head &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Jimbo runs for mayor in the Season 17 episode &quot; See Homer Run &quot;, with a campaign slogan of &quot; Tough on Nerds. Tougher on Dorks. &quot; [ Johnny Tightlips ] Johnny &quot; John &quot; Tightlips, voiced by Hank Azaria, is a member of the Mafia and associate of Fat Tony. He says very little, which spares him from accusations of being a &quot; squealer &quot;, but his reticence tends to be unhelpful to others and even himself. In &quot; The Twisted World of Marge Simpson &quot; he tries to help Fat Tony in taking away Marge&apos;s earnings from her &apos;Pretzel Wagon&apos; franchise. In &quot; Insane Clown Poppy &quot;, there is a shoot-out in Fat Tony&apos;s mansion and Tightlips is shot by accident. When asked where he&apos;s injured, he says &quot; I ain&apos;t sayin&apos; nuthin&apos;! &quot;, and when asked what to tell the doctor he says, &quot; Tell him to suck a lemon. &quot; [ http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF17 Insane Clown Poppy The Simpsons Archive 2008-04-12 ] [ Jub-Jub ] Jub-Jub is Selma Bouvier &apos;s pet iguana and was originally owned by Aunt Gladys. It was first seen in &quot; Selma&apos;s Choice &quot;. Gladys gives Jub-Jub to Jacqueline Bouvier, who is highly unattached to it. As a result, she later passes it on to Selma. Selma once said that Jub-Jub will eat her remains upon her death. The name Jub-Jub was coined by then-writer Conan O&apos;Brien. [ Stern, David 2004 The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Selma&apos;s Choice &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] He often said nonsensical things around the office for no apparent reason, one of which was &quot; Jub-Jub &quot;. (There is, however, a Jubjub bird in The Hunting of the Snark.) Fans of Sportsradio 1310 in Dallas voted that Jub-Jub be the new nickname of morning radio host George Dunham. O&apos;Brien, on October 17, 2007, mentioned his creation of Jub Jub and asked Joe Buck, the play-by-play commentator of the MLB World Series on FOX, to say it during his broadcast. O&apos;Brien promised $1,000.00 to the charity of the announcer&apos;s choice. On October 24, 2007, during Game 1 of the 2007 World Series, Buck called field level reporter, Chris Myers, &quot; our own little Jub-Jub. &quot; Jub-Jub was used as the first Twitter hash tag for O&apos;Brien&apos;s &quot; Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour &quot; in 2010. [ Judge Constance Harm ] Judge Constance Harm, voiced by repeat guest star actress Jane Kaczmarek, is a harsh, unforgiving disciplinarian. { The Simpsons &quot; } { The Parent Rap &quot; - November 4, 2001 } She enjoys creating cruel punishments for criminals in her court and frightening them with a miniature guillotine on the bench. She might be a transsexual based on a statement she makes during her first appearance in &quot; The Parent Rap &quot; : &quot; you remind me of me, when I was a little boy &quot;. Her name is a play on &quot; constant harm &quot;. The character is a parody of Judge Judy. In &quot; On a Clear Day I Can&apos;t See My Sister &quot;, she reveals she has a husband. Although Judge Snyder resolves court cases, Judge Harm has mainly been used for handing down negative verdicts, such as sentencing a family member to prison. She also appears in &quot; Brawl in the Family &quot;, &quot; Barting Over &quot;, &quot; The Wandering Juvie &quot;, &quot; Brake My Wife, Please &quot; and &quot; Chief of Hearts &quot;. { The Simpsons &quot; } { Brake My Wife, Please &quot; - May 11, 2003 } [ Judge Snyder ] Judge Roy Snyder, voiced by Harry Shearer, { Gimple, p. 87 } is a Springfield judge known for his lenient punishments and somewhat unorthodox rulings (as in the episode &quot; Sweets and Sour Marge, &quot; when he bans sugar from Springfield). The character was originally named &quot; Judge Moulton &quot;, but show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein did not know that, and called him &quot; Snyder &quot;. { Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { The Day the Violence Died &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } His appearance is modeled on Robert Bork. Snyder&apos;s skin color has gone back and forth between yellow and brown repeatedly throughout the series. { Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { Krusty Gets Busted &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ &quot; Just Stamp the Ticket &quot; Man ] This man first appears in &quot; When Flanders Failed &quot; when he goes to the Leftorium to get his parking validated because it is the only store that does it without requiring a purchase. Ned Flanders says he is &quot; right as rain, or, as we say around here, &apos;left as rain&apos; but the man bluntly responds &quot; Just stamp the ticket. &quot; His next appearances is in &quot; Homer Alone &quot;, when the Squeaky Voiced Teen tries to hand him a flyer he brushes him off by saying &quot; Don&apos;t touch me &quot;. In a later episode, &quot; Mr. Plow &quot;, he tells Barney Gumble (who is handing out flyers dressed as Lullabuy$&apos;s Big Baby) that he &quot; sickens &quot; him. He reappears again in Homer&apos;s Barbershop Quartet, at the Springfield Swap Meet, he derides Marge &apos;s &quot; cool &quot; wishbone necklaces, stating he doubted his &quot; son or daughter is that stupid &quot;. The character also appears in the episodes &quot; Homer Loves Flanders &quot;, &quot; Homer and Apu &quot;, &quot; Bart of Darkness &quot; (in which he punched a hippie for singing &quot; Sunshine On My Shoulders &quot; ) and &quot; Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy &quot;. [ Dr. J. Loren Pryor ] Dr. J. Loren Pryor, voiced by Harry Shearer, is the school psychologist. He is based on an early design for Seymour Skinner, and first appears in &quot; Bart the Genius &quot; where he decides to send Bart to a school for gifted children after Bart cheats on a test. Bart later approaches him to request returning to Springfield Elementary. In &quot; Bart Gets an F &quot;, he tells Bart that he may have to repeat the fourth grade. He appears again, discussing Bart&apos;s problems at school and Lisa&apos;s special gift in a flashback sequence of &quot; Lisa&apos;s Sax &quot;. In this episode he also inadvertently reveals that Milhouse Van Houten possesses &quot; flamboyantly homosexual &quot; tendencies. Pryor does not appear again for several years until the episode &quot; See Homer Run &quot;, in which he tells Lisa that she is going through a developmental condition. [ Kearney Zzyzwicz ] Kearney Zzyzwicz, voiced by Nancy Cartwright, is one of Springfield Elementary&apos;s many bullies. He has a buzz cut, and wears a torn white T-shirt, blue shorts, and studded wristbands. Although he looks and sounds to be around Jimbo or Dolph &apos;s age, Kearney is actually older. He is the only Springfield Elementary School student who remembers the Watergate Scandal and the 1976 Bicenntenial (according to Principal Skinner), was in Otto the bus driver&apos;s third-grade class (according to Otto), owns a car (even though he rode the school bus on &quot; A Milhouse Divided &quot;, &quot; The Mook, the Chef, the Wife, and Her Homer &quot;, and &quot; How the Test Was Won &quot; ), regularly shaves, has custody of a child from a divorce, is old enough to vote in a general U.S. election, was sent to prison, and pays taxes. In &quot; She of Little Faith &quot;, Kearney dated Jimbo&apos;s mother. In the same episode, it is revealed that he is on the church council of the First Church of Springfield and is &quot; a teenager and the parent of a teenager &quot;. [ She of Little Faith She of Little Faith The Simpsons The Simpsons 2001-12-16 13 6 ] Kearney often relies on (or tricks) Homer into procuring alcohol for himself and his friends (as seen in &quot; The Springfield Connection &quot;, &quot; Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious &quot;, and &quot; Last Tap Dance in Springfield &quot; ), and once used a fake ID (as seen in &quot; Much Apu About Nothing &quot; ), though it is heavily implied that Kearney is of the legal age to buy alcohol for himself (as in &quot; El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer &quot;, in which he is seen drinking at Moe&apos;s Tavern ). Kearney&apos;s last name (Zzyzwicz) was revealed in a computer file in season 18&apos;s &quot; 24 Minutes &quot;. Prior to that episode, Kearney&apos;s surname was never mentioned. In &quot; Bart Gets a &apos;Z&apos; &quot;, Kearney can be seen sitting in the back row of Bart&apos;s classroom, implying that Kearney is a fourth grader. Kearney&apos;s father was shown on the season eight episode &quot; The Homer They Fall &quot;, but in &quot; O Brother, Where Bart Thou? &quot;, Kearney reveals that both of his parents are incarcerated and they only meet when the prison and insane asylum have their annual mixer. [ Kirk Van Houten ] Kirk Van Houten is voiced by Hank Azaria. He is the father of Milhouse, and the remarried husband of Luann Van Houten. He wears glasses just like his son and wife. He first appeared in &quot; Bart&apos;s Friend Falls in Love &quot;. Kirk has been portrayed as a stereotypical middle-aged male loser and deadbeat dad. Much of his character revolves around his extreme emotional depression after his divorce from his wife Luann. Luann got custody of Milhouse when they divorced, but Kirk has visiting rights and is often seen with Milhouse in later episodes. Kirk suffers from the need to cry all the time after his divorce, even in good times. The Van Houtens remarried in the nineteenth season episode &quot; Little Orphan Millie &quot;. In that episode it was established that Kirk is of Dutch and Danish ancestry. Kirk previously served in the U.S. Army, and attended Gudger College. Apparently Kirk&apos;s mother is of Greek ancestry, based on the nineteenth season episode &quot; Husbands and Knives &quot;. In the episode, Milhouse says, &quot; But that&apos;s the money Yaya Sophia gave me for Greek Orthodox Easter! &quot;. According to Luann, Kirk was not a very good provider, and she had to borrow money from her sister to make ends meet. When Luann demands a divorce, Kirk is all too happy to oblige. Unfortunately, he loses his middle-management job at Southern Cracker, a job given to him by Luann&apos;s father, as a result. Kirk briefly attempts a career as a singer-songwriter, recording a demo tape of an original song titled &quot; Can I Borrow A Feeling &quot;, with mediocre results. Later, he attempts to win Luann back by singing the song to her. Luann does not reciprocate Kirk&apos;s feelings, choosing instead to remain with her boyfriend. Kirk reveals in the episode &quot; I Am Furious Yellow &quot;, where he visits his son&apos;s school on career day, that he was currently employed as an assistant to the guy who puts fliers under people&apos;s windshield wipers. Kirk also had a job standing on the curb holding a sign directing people to a condo development and worked as a scarecrow protecting a soy-bean crop, which resulted in his eye being gouged by a crow. Since being fired from the cracker company, Kirk seems to be unable to maintain a steady job. He once shouted at Luann that she had to keep up the alimony payments she owed him, and he has been seen at the Springfield unemployment office, perhaps suggesting that alimony and unemployment benefits are his only steady sources of income. Kirk was put in jail in the episode &quot; Pranksta Rap &quot; for &quot; kidnapping &quot; Bart which he greatly enjoyed due to him being envied by women and fed three meals a day. In The Simpsons Movie, Kirk is briefly seen attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. [ Laura Powers ] Laura Powers, voiced by Sara Gilbert is the teenage daughter of Ruth Powers. Her first and only appearance is in the episode &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot; when she and Ruth move in next door to the Simpsons. When Marge and Homer ask her to babysit Bart, Lisa and Maggie, Bart immediately develops a crush on her. However he is shocked to find out that she is dating local bully Jimbo Jones whom she later breaks up with after Moe threatens to kill Jimbo over a prank call that Bart made. Ruth mentions Laura in &quot; Marge On The Lam &quot; when Ruth tells Marge that she has to head home before her daughter watches &quot; that naked talk show. &quot; [ Legs and Louie ] Legs, voiced by Karl Wiedergott (formerly voiced by Hank Azaria ), and Louie, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, are the two Springfield Mafia hitmen who accompany Fat Tony at all times. The two lack any real definitive characteristic and are almost always seen together. Legs has a dark blonde short haircut and raspy voice. Louie has a slight black afro and a more high-pitched, even squeaky tone. Castellaneta based the voice on actor Joe Pesci, one of the several references to Goodfellas used in the episode &quot; Bart the Murderer &quot;. { Castellaneta, Dan (2009). Commentary for &quot; } { Insane Clown Poppy &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Louie says that tear gas is &quot; [his] one weakness, &quot; though this is likely an embellishment. Dan Castellaneta was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 2011 for the voice of Louie, Homer Simpson, Barney Gumble, and Krusty the Clown thanks to the episode Donnie Fatso.

He is a large, surly, snarling man who frequently speaks through clenched teeth, and is one of the few characters on The Simpsons to have eyebrow s. When Principal Skinner has to be temporarily replaced, Leopold stomps in, issues several threats, and terrifies the children by making them think he is the replacement, and then suddenly politely introduces the actual substitute, Ned Flanders. The children then collectively sigh with relief. The gag was repeated when Marge Simpson becomes a substitute teacher in the episode &quot; The PTA Disbands &quot;. Leopold often refers to the children of Springfield Elementary as &quot; little freaks. &quot; [ http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F18.html [1F18] Sweet Seymour Skinner&apos;s Baadasssss Song 2008-03-01 Cherry James A. 1996-07-21 Episode transcript The Simpsons Archive (snpp.com) ] [ http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F19.html [2F19] The PTA Disbands 2008-03-01 Cherry James A. 1997-02-22 Episode transcript The Simpsons Archive (snpp.com) ] [ Lewis ] Lewis Jackson is an African American character, and student at Springfield Elementary School in Bart&apos;s class. He can be seen playing the bassoon in the opening sequence of the show. Although one of the most minor characters in the show, Lewis appears frequently in scenes involving the Springfield children, and occasionally speaks. He is usually seen with Richard. While Lewis has never had significant dialogue, he has been voiced by Nancy Cartwright, Jo Ann Harris, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille, and Russi Taylor throughout the series. Lewis&apos;s seeming insignificance to the show is underscored in the episode &quot; Das Bus &quot;, in which Bart mistakenly calls him &quot; Wendell &quot;. [ Lindsey Naegle ] Lindsey Naegle is voiced by Tress MacNeille and first appeared in the eighth season episode &quot; The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show &quot;. { McCann, p. 88 } In that episode, she had no name and was known only as &quot; The Generic Female TV Executive &quot;. She appeared again in &quot; Girly Edition &quot;, also as a generic female TV executive (only her hair and facial features differed from her first appearance). { Gimple, p. 37 } In &quot; They Saved Lisa&apos;s Brain &quot;, she was introduced as &quot; Lindsey Naegle &quot;, a member of the Springfield Chapter of Mensa, and has since become a recurring character. The writers modeled Naegle on a number of network executives that they have encountered while working on the show. { Weinstein, Josh (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The character gets her last name from Hollywood talent agent Sue Naegle, president of HBO Entertainment and wife of Simpsons writer Dana Gould. { Selman, Matt (2007). Commentary for &quot; } { They Saved Lisa&apos;s Brain &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id%3D20080409hbo01 Breaking News  — Sue Naegle Joins HBO as President, HBO Entertainment, Overseeing All Series Programming and Specials Thefutoncritic.com 2009-01-02 ] Writer Matt Selman chose the first name &quot; Lindsey &quot; because he thought it sounded like the name of an annoyingly talkative woman. Naegle prototypes have appeared throughout the series, such as the OmniTouch Rep from &quot; Make Room for Lisa &quot; and Laramie executive Mindy from &quot; E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt) &quot;. { Turner, p. 167 } In &quot; Blame It on Lisa &quot;, it is revealed that she frequently changes jobs because she is a sexual predator. Chris Turner, author of the book Planet Simpson, called Naegle &quot; an excellent allegory for the modern corporate age: you don&apos;t see through her because there&apos;s nothing else to see. &quot; { Turner, p. 168 } Her political allegiances are not concrete: In &quot; You Kent Always Say What You Want, &quot; she is shown at the Republican Party headquarters; in &quot; E Pluribus Wiggum, &quot; Naegle is conversely depicted as a Democrat. [ Lois Pennycandy ] Lois Pennycandy is the beautiful executive assistant to Krusty the Clown. { &quot; } { Like Father, Like Clown &quot; } She swayed Krusty into visiting Bart after he saved Krusty from jail time, { &quot; } { Krusty Gets Busted &quot; } and later reunited him with his estranged father the Rabbi Hyman Krustofski. She was at Krusty&apos;s side during the auditions in which Robert Terwilliger became Krusty&apos;s new sidekick, { &quot; } { Brother from Another Series &quot; } and was at Krusty&apos;s &quot; funeral &quot; when he was presumed dead after crashing his private plane into a cliff. { &quot; } { Bart the Fink &quot; } In a phone conversation, Marge once asked her, &quot; How can [Krusty] hurt someone who loves him so? &quot; While looking at a framed photo of Krusty, Pennycandy replied, &quot; Oh, Mrs. Simpson, I&apos;ve wasted my womanhood asking that same question. &quot; Her only speaking roles are in &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot; and &quot; Krusty Gets Kancelled &quot;, in which she was voiced by Pamela Hayden. [ Luann Van Houten ] Luann Van Houten is voiced by Maggie Roswell. When Roswell left the show in 1998, she became a primarily nonspeaking character. However, Roswell returned in 2002. Since the season 8 episode, &quot; A Milhouse Divided &quot;, Luann was depicted as a promiscuous, single mother, who stuck her successful love life in the face of her ex-husband, Kirk. She first appeared in &quot; Homer Defined &quot;. She wears glasses, a trait that she shares with her husband and son. Luann Van Houten&apos;s mother is Italian. She was born in Shelbyville, and moved to Springfield in early life. It is stated in &quot; A Milhouse Divided &quot; that she has a sister. Luann was married to Kirk for several years, giving birth to a son, Milhouse, yet the marriage was an unhappy one. After an argument over a game of Pictionary, she leaves Kirk after he remarks he can&apos;t draw &quot; dignity &quot;, since he gave it up when he married her. Although Kirk found the new liberty of a single life tough, Luann uses her newfound freedom to live life on the fast lane. Luann began dating American Gladiator Pyro shortly after her divorce with Kirk for several seasons, but was caught cheating on him with his best friend, Gyro. In Apu Nahasapeemapetilon &apos;s bachelor years, she had been one of his bachelorettes. In &quot; Milhouse of Sand and Fog &quot;, it is revealed that Luann had also gone out with Disco Stu as well and had begun a relationship with Sea Captain. In &quot; Milhouse of Sand and Fog &quot; the Van Houtens reunited. Since then, they are often seen together (although in the episode &quot; Ice Cream of Margie (with the Light Blue Hair) &quot;, Kirk was seen with Milhouse at a single father&apos;s outing, showing he and Luann were still not married). As of &quot; Little Orphan Millie &quot;, they are remarried.She And Kirk Had A Little Appearance In &quot; Moe Goes From Rags To Riches &quot; [ Luigi Risotto ] Luigi Risotto, voiced by Hank Azaria, { Gimple, p. 86 } is the proprietor of Luigi&apos;s, a Springfield Italian restaurant. He is a parody of the &quot; Italian pasta/pizza chef &quot; stereotype (and in fact is on a bowling team called &quot; The Stereotypes &quot; along with Cletus Spuckler, Captain Horatio McCallister, and Groundskeeper Willie ), but seems to be aware of his status as a stock character. He is polite to his customers and treats them with respect when they order and then loudly insults and belittles them to his cook Salvatore, apparently unaware that they can hear him from the kitchen. In the episode &quot; The Last of the Red Hat Mamas, &quot; he reveals that he does not speak Italian. It is hinted that Luigi is an illegal immigrant, even though he tried to run for mayor, telling Springfielders, &quot; I make-a you the good government, just how-a you like it! &quot; The animators copied Luigi&apos;s appearance from a chef that was on the front of a pizza box. { Mirkin, David (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Sweet Seymour Skinner&apos;s Baadasssss Song &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Lunchlady Doris ] Lunchlady Doris Freedman, voiced by Doris Grau up until her death, and now voiced by Tress MacNeille, is a sardonic chef for Springfield Elementary. She can frequently be seen serving deeply unpleasant meals, such as animal genitalia and ground up gym mats, because of the school budget cutbacks. She has also made a handful of appearances acting as a school nurse, apparently due to budget cutbacks. In the episode Team Homer it is suggested that she is the mother of Jeremy Freedman (a.k.a. the Squeaky-voiced Teen ). After Grau&apos;s death in 1995, Lunchlady Doris was retired out of respect for over 10 years. Due to the delay between recording some episodes and the time they actually air, Grau&apos;s voice was included in episodes airing as late as 1997 such as &quot; Lisa&apos;s Sax &quot;. [ http://snpp.com/guides/doris.html The Simpsons Archive: The Lunchlady Doris File Snpp.com 2005-08-28 2011-10-23 ] Lunchlady Doris is seen as a silent background character until she speaks in the 18th season during &quot; The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer &quot;, where she is voiced by Tress MacNeille, season 19&apos;s &quot; The Debarted &quot;, where she is again voiced by Tress MacNeille but with a different voice, and season 20&apos;s &quot; Father Knows Worst &quot;. [ Lurleen Lumpkin ] Lurleen Lumpkin (voiced by Beverly D&apos;Angelo ) is an aspiring country singer who is managed by Homer in &quot; Colonel Homer &quot;. Homer discovers her in a redneck bar in the middle of nowhere and is amazed by her voice. He decides to help her launch a singing career, much to the chagrin of Marge. Grateful for Homer&apos;s help, Lurleen becomes attracted to him and tries to lure him with an erotic song called &quot; Bunk with Me Tonight &quot;. Homer, who had been ignorant of this, suddenly realizes that managing Lurleen could hurt his marriage, so he quits as her manager. A saddened Lurleen sings a song called &quot; Stand By Your Manager &quot;. Lurleen&apos;s next appearance is in &quot; Krusty Gets Kancelled &quot;, in which she is briefly seen in the center square of Springfield Squares. In an earlier episode, &quot; Marge vs. the Monorail &quot;, a much rougher-looking Lurleen, voiced by Doris Grau, makes a brief appearance, in which it is revealed that she had been to the Betty Ford Clinic and &quot; spent last night in a ditch &quot;. In this episode her voice sounds exactly the same as Lunchlady Doris &apos;s, rather than her soft, Southern voice she had when she was first introduced. The nineteenth season episode &quot; Papa Don&apos;t Leech &quot; { IGN TV tv.ign.com. Retrieved July 29, 2007. } follows up on her story with her moving into the Simpsons&apos; home and taking a waitress job at Moe&apos;s in order to pay a $12 million tax bill. It is revealed she has a father named Royce Boss Hogg Lumpkin, who was never much supportive of her and had been missing for years. Marge undertakes efforts to find him and reunite him with Lurleen. As soon as it happens, Lurleen writes a new, upbeat composition called &quot; Daddy&apos;s Back &quot;, but Royce sells the song, taking the writing credits for himself (but altering some lyrics), to the Dixie Chicks. As soon as she learns of this, Lurleen confronts Royce and reveals the truth to the Dixie Chicks, who assault him with their musical instruments and invite Lurleen to join their tour. Lurleen ends up engaged to a man who looks very much like Homer (like her previous husbands did) and tours as an opening act for the Dixie Chicks. [ Dr. Marvin Monroe ] Dr. Marvin Monroe is a psychotherapist who first appeared in the first season episode &quot; There&apos;s No Disgrace Like Home &quot;. Homer pawns the family television in order to afford a session with Monroe for him and his dysfunctional family. The failed attempt at therapy culminates with the Simpsons electroshocking each other endlessly, to the point of causing a blackout. Unable to help the Simpsons, Monroe refunds double what the Simpsons paid, and the Simpsons buy a new TV. Monroe appears in &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot; in which 70% of that episode&apos;s original animation had to be redone, although the scenes involving Monroe were mostly untouched, said co-director David Silverman. { Silverman, David (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { Some Enchanted Evening &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The script of &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot; describes Monroe as &quot; a heavy, chain-smoking, compulsive eater. &quot; { Script for &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The original idea behind the character, said Matt Groening, was that he was born Marilyn Monroe and was &quot; very caught up over that &quot;, which is why he became a therapist. { Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Monroe&apos;s voice is based on psychiatrist David Viscott &apos;s. { Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for &quot; } { There&apos;s No Disgrace Like Home &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Among Monroe&apos;s works is Dr. Marvin Monroe&apos;s Guide to Etiquette, which Bart receives as a birthday gift in &quot; Radio Bart &quot;. Since the seventh season, the character Monroe has been retired. This is because voicing the character strained Harry Shearer &apos;s throat and, eventually, the voice became too annoying for Groening, which, he acknowledges, is the point. { Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } { Groening, Matt (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { Treehouse of Horror II &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The character&apos;s retirement was marked by the broadcast of a Dr. Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital over Lou &apos;s walkie-talkie in &quot; Who Shot Mr. Burns? &quot;, Part Two. { Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two) &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Since then, several references to Monroe being dead have been made: a glimpse of his gravestone in &quot; Alone Again, Natura-diddily &quot;, a Dr. Marvin Monroe Memorial Gymnasium seen in &quot; Bye Bye Nerdie &quot;, and an interstitial in the &quot; 138th Episode Spectacular &quot;. However, Monroe is seen alive in the fifteenth season in &quot; Diatribe of a Mad Housewife &quot; to purchase a copy of Marge&apos;s novel &quot; The Harpooned Heart &quot;, stating simply that he has &quot;...been very sick &quot; when asked about his absence by Marge. [ Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon ] Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon is the wife of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and the mother of their eight children. She first appeared as a little girl in Apu&apos;s flashback in the seventh season episode &quot; Much Apu About Nothing &quot;, in which Apu tells her that he is sorry that their arranged marriage will not happen, before getting on a plane departing for the U.S. to pursue the American Dream. Her first adult appearance is in the ninth season episode The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons. { Cohen, David (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { Much Apu About Nothing &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } She claims that Fried Green Tomatoes is her favorite book, movie, and food. She has excellent culinary skills, demonstrated by her ability to make a wide variety of dishes using only chickpeas, lentils, and sometimes rice. She is also one of Marge&apos;s best and only friends, and they often walk their babies together. In &quot; The Sweetest Apu &quot;, Apu has an affair with the Squishee lady. After Homer discovers this, he and Marge confront Apu, who caves under the guilt and vows to apologize to Manjula, who sets him a number of grueling tasks in penance. [ Cohen, David The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season DVD Video Collector&apos;s Edition commentary for the episode &quot; Much Apu About Nothing &quot; DVD Twentieth Century Fox ] Writer Richard Appel had pitched the idea of Apu marrying years before he wrote &quot; The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons &quot; for season nine. { Appel, Richard (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } For that episode, it took several attempts by the character designers to model Manjula because making women look appealing in Matt Groening &apos;s drawing style is hard for the animators to do. { Moore, Steven Dean (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } { Kirkland, Mark (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { Colonel Homer &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Writer David Cohen named Manjula after a friend of much of the staff. Manjula was voiced by former Saturday Night Live cast member Jan Hooks from seasons 9 to 14, { Gimple, p. 64 } by Tress MacNeille in season 15 (only one appearance) and Maggie Roswell thereafter. [ Martha Prince ] Martha Prince, voiced by Russi Taylor, is the wife of Martin Prince Sr. and mother of Martin Prince. Martha is probably best known for attempting to sell Martin&apos;s extremely valuable Star Wars merchandise to Comic Book Guy for an extremely cheap price. She was warned by Bart and Milhouse before she sold them and decided to not to sell them. It was also hinted by Martin that she shoplifts a lot, &quot; stuff she doesn&apos;t even need &quot;. She also was responsible for all of the guests getting sick at Martin&apos;s birthday party, by serving diseased oysters instead of cake, with the exception of Bart, Lisa, Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel. [ Martha Quimby ] Martha Quimby is the wife of the Mayor of Springfield Joseph Quimby. She wears a pink outfit and a pillbox hat similar to the outfit worn by Jackie Kennedy on the day of the Kennedy assassination. According to Mayor Quimby, the couple met while Martha was working at the &quot; Maison Derrière &quot;, a local burlesque house. She first appeared in &quot; Bart Gets Famous &quot;, { Richmond, p. 215 } when she walks in on Mayor Quimby in bed with another woman, an event she laughs off when he defends himself with &quot; I didn&apos;t do it. &quot; She is humiliated when Marge accidentally uncovers her husband&apos;s lothario ways in &quot; The Last of the Red Hat Mamas &quot; and kicks Marge and her friends out before they can have tea. Martha Quimby is voiced by Maggie Roswell. [ Martin Prince ] Martin Prince, Jr. { The Simpsons, &quot; } { Bart the Genius &quot; - January 14, 1990 } is a recurring character in the Fox animated series, The Simpsons, and is voiced by Russi Taylor. Martin is Bart Simpson &apos;s classmate, and is Lisa Simpson &apos;s rival in intelligence, as well as Nelson Muntz &apos;s favorite target for bullying. He is an academically brilliant, teacher&apos;s pet, and is portrayed as a stereotypical nerd, and is a 4th grade student at Springfield Elementary School. Martin is the son of Martin, Sr. and Martha. He is an academically brilliant student, portrayed when he first appears in the second episode of the series. He is also a teacher&apos;s pet with the stereotypical nerd enthusiasms for science fiction, role-playing game s and not-so-great fashion sense. He has an IQ of 216. As the class nerd, he unwittingly becomes the perfect target for ruthless bullying at Springfield Elementary School. He is a member of the Springfield band, and is often seen with a French Horn. Martin&apos;s most famous catchphrases are &quot; Behold! &quot; and &quot; Excelsior! &quot;. [ Martin Prince, Sr. ] Martin Prince, Sr. is the father of Martin Prince, and husband of Martha Prince. He is a stock broker in Springfield and was shown bringing his son to work on &quot; Go To Work With Your Parents Day &quot;, where Martin made over $1 million trading soy futures (and subsequently lost all but $600). He appears to be a nerd much like his son, seeing as he has somewhat of a lisp. Martin Sr. was also one of the fathers that went in Ned Flanders&apos;s RV, to find their sons in Shelbyville. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. [ Mary Bailey ] Mary Bailey is the governor of Springfield&apos;s state. She is voiced by Maggie Roswell. She ran against Mr. Burns in &quot; Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish &quot;, winning in a landslide after Mr. Burns spit out a piece of baked Three eyed Fish during a photo-op at the Simpsons&apos; home. Mary Bailey would later appear briefly in the episode &quot; Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade &quot; when Bart and Lisa&apos;s class visit Capital City. They show Bailey their class projects (designing a new state flag). Mary Bailey wails in disgust after unfurling Lisa&apos;s flag. Bart had redesigned it to look like a butt with &quot; Learn to Fart &quot; underneath. She also appears in &quot; The Seven-Beer Snitch &quot; where a prison is built out of a defunct concert hall. She decides to release all the abused prisoners to a garbage barge where they would &quot; bare-knuckle box until one of you emerges as king of your floating hell. &quot; She looks nearly identical to Bea Simmons, Abe Simpson&apos;s former girlfriend in the episode Old Money. [ Maude Flanders ] Maude Flanders, voiced by Maggie Roswell and temporarily by Marcia Mitzman Gaven between 1999 and 2000 when Roswell did not work for the show, was the wife of Ned Flanders, and the mother of Rod and Todd. While she was not employed outside the home, Maude was a busy homemaker and a tireless advocate for the children, whose innocence is so often sullied by the &quot; evils &quot; of cartoon violence, liberal education, and the insidious influences of popular culture. Even though she spent much of her free time in prayer and reading the Bible and helping out her husband at the Leftorium, Maude was known to let her hair down for the occasional dinner party at the home of her neighbors, the Simpsons. Homer often made statements insinuating his attraction to Maude, thereby literally coveting his neighbor&apos;s wife. Also, in the second season episode &quot; The War of the Simpsons &quot;, Homer ogled Maude&apos;s cleavage at a dinner party, which resulted in him and Marge going to marriage camp. In the season eleven episode &quot; Alone Again, Natura-Diddily &quot;, Maude was killed by a t-shirt cannon at the Springfield Speedway when Homer ducked at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. [ Seifert Andy Indiana Man says no to the White Sox T-shirt cannons http://www.avclub.com/chicago/articles/indiana-man-says-no-to-the-white-sox-tshirt-cannon%2C26920/ The A.V. Club 2009-04-26 2010-08-08 ] She was knocked off the grandstand and her rescue was prevented as Homer had parked in the ambulance zone, impeding their rescue attempt. Her death crushed Ned who, though used to some measure of hardship, assumed that they would always be together. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show.

Maude also appears in &quot; Treehouse of Horror XXII &quot; as the devil&apos;s wife. [ Ms. Albright ] Ms. Albright is voiced by Tress MacNeille. { Richmond, p. 179 } She is the First Church of Springfield Sunday school teacher. She first appeared in &quot; The Telltale Head &quot;. She speaks with a soft Southern accent. She appears to be good friends with Helen Lovejoy. She is occasionally seen in the background of various episodes as well as in church scenes (such as in &quot; The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star &quot; ). [ Miss Springfield ] Miss Springfield (voiced by Pamela Hayden ) is a beauty pageant winner, who first appears in &quot; Whacking Day &quot;. She is the lover of Mayor Quimby, and is seen several times in bed with him. She only appears with the sash and the crown of Miss Springfield. In &quot; Mayored to the Mob &quot;, she is one of two women escorting Mayor Quimby to a convention. Since then, she is often seen escorting him to Springfield events such as conventions, recitals, and plays. In one episode, it is revealed she is illiterate. Quimby scolds her for lying about her graduating from &quot; typing school &quot;. She then admits she has trouble with the space bar. In &quot; Smoke on the Daughter &quot;, she appears (and claims to be) pregnant, and Quimby believes he may be the father. [ Mr. Costington ] Mr. Costington, voiced by Hank Azaria, is the president of Costington&apos;s Department Store. He first appeared as &quot; Chairman &quot; { Gimple, p. 38 } in the season nine episode &quot; Trash of the Titans &quot;, in which he invented &quot; Love Day &quot;, and later in &quot; Homer vs. Dignity &quot;. He is one of very few characters on the show who has eyebrows. Costington&apos;s catchphrase is &quot; You&apos;re fiiired! &quot;, delivered while shaking his jowls. In &quot; The Boys of Bummer &quot;, he hires Homer with a jowl-shaking &quot; You&apos;re hiiired! &quot; Homer has worked for him on three occasions: as a Thanksgiving Day Parade Santa Claus, mattress salesman, and model for top-brand jeans. He also employs the Yes Guy, who is seen working at the store in most of his appearances.

He first appeared in &quot; Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge &quot;. Like Krusty, he is a heavy smoker, and often seems depressed off-stage. He is sometimes seen as Krusty’s driver and butler. Teeny’s uncle was former head monkey at the ministry of tourism in Brazil. Three other monkeys have died while working for Krusty known by the same name. Krusty once said he missed the third Mr. Teeny and the current one couldn’t hold a candle to him. In the episode &quot; Day of the Jackanapes &quot; Teeny saves Krusty from a bomb that Sideshow Bob has attached to Bart. His mother’s name is Toot-Toot, and she refers to him as Louis when they are reunited in &quot; Bart Has Two Mommies &quot;. Teeny also was a writer for the “Good Guy Awards” and quit after being insulted on-stage by Krusty. He is an immigrant from Brazil and has been deported but was returned. He wears a pink hat and bow tie but has also been seen in a tuxedo and golden encrusted thong. Krusty has implied that if he can not find a human willing to donate a lung when he gets cancer, he is planning on harvesting one from Mr. Teeny. As of &quot; Wedding For Disaster &quot;, there have been seven Mr. Teenys. [ Mrs. Glick ] Alice { The Simpsons season 23, episode 4: &quot; } { Replaceable You &quot; } Glick is an elderly shut-in for whom Bart did chores in &quot; Three Men and a Comic Book &quot;; he didn&apos;t get paid very well, so he started to hate her. She had a brother named Asa, mentioned in the same episode, who died during World War I; he was killed by his own grenade, which he held for too long. Doctor Hibbert once confessed to leaving his car keys inside her. She is occasionally seen in the background of various episodes, often with a toothless laugh. She is a stereotypical lonely old woman, who spends her days &quot; watching her stories. &quot; She was originally voiced by Cloris Leachman { Richmond, p. 57 } and later by Tress MacNeille. She later dies due to a heart attack caused by an invention Bart and Martin create in the episode &quot; Replaceable You &quot;. Her final scene is dancing with Jesus in Heaven. [ Mrs. Muntz ] Mrs. Muntz, voiced by Tress MacNeille. She is Nelson Muntz &apos;s mother. Nelson receives his trademark laugh from her. Early on in the series, Nelson would often mention his parents, and it was often implied that Nelson&apos;s mother does not care for him. In &quot; A Milhouse Divided &quot;, Nelson tells Milhouse that his mom is addicted to cough drop s, which is why his father left the family.Mrs. Muntz works at Hooters in &quot; Bart Star &quot;, but was fired in a later episode for gaining weight. She owns a dilapidated house and is depicted as a jailbird, a prostitute, a stripper, or something similar. In &quot; &apos;Tis the Fifteenth Season &quot;, she appears, telling Nelson that his father simply did not like him, and he left with her golden tooth. Nelson&apos;s mother was fully introduced in &quot; Sleeping with the Enemy &quot;, after years of being mentioned. A loud, high-pitched contemptuous woman, she neglects Nelson. She implies she misses Nelson&apos;s father. At the end of the episode, the three Muntzes reunite, and she receives a new job as Lady Macbeth, with &quot; the third director she slept with &quot;. Since then, she is often seen around in Springfield. Curiously, in Season 18 &apos;s &quot; The Haw-Hawed Couple &quot;, she appears with brown hair. As revealed in &quot; Dial &apos;N&apos; for Nerder &quot;, Nelson even refers to her as Mrs. Muntz. [ Old Barber ] Jake the Barber { McCann, p. 86 } originated in one of the Tracey Ullman shorts, &quot; Bart&apos;s Haircut &quot;. { Silverman, David (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { Homer Defined &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox } In the short, he cuts Bart&apos;s hair not to his liking and Bart tries several ways to hide it. Dan Castellaneta, voiced the Old Barber in that short and in subsequent episodes in the series, based the voice on comedian Bob Elliott &apos;s. { Castellaneta, Dan (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { Homer Defined &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox } The Old Barber made his last appearance in the twelfth season episode &quot; Lisa the Tree Hugger &quot;. He was voiced by Harry Shearer in that episode. { McCann, p. 87 } David Silverman had to create a model sheet of the Old Barber for Jim Reardon, who directed &quot; 22 Short Films about Springfield. &quot; Before then, there was no model sheet for the character. { Reardon, Jim; Silverman, David (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox } [ Old Jewish Man ] Asa, a.k.a. Old Jewish Man, or Crazy Old Man (according to &quot; Krusty Gets Kancelled &quot; ) is Abraham Simpson and Jasper Beardly &apos;s friend. Mayor Quimby once referred to him as &quot; Old Jewish Man &quot;; also, a list of heart recipients in &quot; Homer&apos;s Paternity Coot &quot; listed him as &quot; Old Jewish Man &quot;. He speaks with a stereotypical Jewish-American accent (voiced by Hank Azaria ), and curses in Yiddish in one episode. He is apparently friendly with Krusty the Clown and Krusty&apos;s father, according to &quot; Simpsons Christmas Stories &quot;. He is often seen yelling at people, and as seen in &quot; Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores &quot;, owns a store called Zip Boys, a parody of Pep Boys. He once had a brief period of stardom after his act of dancing on a street corner singing &quot; The Old Gray Mare &quot; with his pants down became a hit on television. In &quot; Natural Born Kissers &quot;, it was revealed that he worked as a studio executive during the making of Casablanca and suppressed an alternate ending to the film. He was also responsible for a &quot; Killing Spree Ending &quot; to It&apos;s a Wonderful Life. He observes that the quality of studio management has changed over the years. In &quot; Love Is a Many Strangled Thing &quot; he dies by dancing too hard, although his ghost continues dancing. He reappears in &quot; Replaceable You &quot; alive. [ Opal ] Opal (voiced by Tress MacNeille ) is a talk show host. This celebrity is based on Oprah, as is her show. She first appears in &quot; Ice Cream of Margie (with the Light Blue Hair) &quot; where her segment on successful women depresses Marge, who feels her life of chores and child-raising has left her without any purpose. She later appeared in the back-to-back nineteenth season episodes &quot; Husbands and Knives &quot; and &quot; Funeral for a Fiend &quot;. Marge is a fan of hers, and was interviewed by Opal after achieving success through her chain of Shapes gyms for women. [ Otto Mann ] Otto Mann voiced by Harry Shearer is the school bus driver for Springfield Elementary School. Otto is notable for his maniacal driving style (which, along with never getting a driver&apos;s license, cost him his job on the season three episode &quot; The Otto Show &quot; ), his love of heavy metal music, drugs and his propensity for sounding and acting like a perpetual 1980s teenager. In early seasons he is often used as a friend and confidant to Bart, despite their age difference. Later seasons, however, usually only depict him as a passerby citizen of Springfield. He is a (last-minute) member of Homer&apos;s bowling team, the &quot; Pin Pals &quot;. { &quot; } { Team Homer &quot; } Otto is a skilled guitarist, having done little else but practice during high school. { &quot; } { The Otto Show &quot; } [ Patches and Poor Violet ] Patches and Poor Violet are two of Springfield&apos;s orphans, voiced by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille, respectively. Introduced in “ Miracle on Evergreen Terrace,” Patches gives the dollar they were saving to Bart, which was their vitamin money. They have since had cameos in “ I&apos;m Goin&apos; to Praiseland ” and “ Simple Simpson,” but are seen in many other episodes. Poor Violet often has a cough, while Patches seems to vaguely resemble Tiny Tim from Charles Dickens ’ A Christmas Carol. Their skin color is not the “healthy” yellow of the Simpson family, but rather a more sallow, sickly tone. [ Plopper ] [ Spider-Pig For the variation of Spider-Man who happens to be a pig, see Spider-Ham. For the song of the same name, see The Simpsons Movie: The Music ] Plopper, also known as Spider-Pig and later renamed to Harry Plopper (a play on the popular fictional character Harry Potter ), is a pig who first appears in The Simpsons Movie. Plopper has since become memetic, gaining immense popularity in the real world and on the internet, especially his theme song &quot; Spider-Pig &quot;, which peaked at number 23 in the UK Singles Chart. [ http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id%3D33298 Hans Zimmer - Spider Pig Chart Stats 2011-10-23 ] The pig is voiced by Tress MacNeille. Plopper has also made appearances in the episodes and comics, and also appears in the reanimated opening sequence, featuring in the pan across Springfield. Plopper&apos;s first appearance is in the movie, where he stars in a TV ad to promote Krusty&apos;s new burger, The Clogger. After the filming is completed, Krusty orders the pig to be killed. Homer becomes upset about this, and immediately adopts him. Homer then spends a lot of time with Plopper and neglects Bart. Later in the movie, Homer is seen making the pig walk on the ceiling whilst singing &quot; Spider Pig &quot;, a parody of the Spider-Man theme song. Homer later calls him Harry Plopper, and the pig is seen with glasses and a lightning bolt-shaped scar, based on the character Harry Potter. At one point in the movie, the Simpsons&apos; house is completely destroyed after being sucked into a sinkhole in their backyard. This may lead to the assumption that the pig is killed in the movie. However, during the 2007 San Diego Comic Convention, an official Simpsons Panel revealed that there was a scene at the end of the movie involving the pig that was cut which later appeared on the DVD. { IGN: SDCC 07: The Simpsons Panel } This removed sequence is a slightly alternate ending of the movie when the townspeople are rebuilding the Simpsons&apos; house and involves Plopper, the Multi-Eyed Creature, and Santa&apos;s Little Helper painting a dog house. During the following TV seasons, Plopper makes a few more appearances. [ Poochie ] When network executives decided that The Itchy and Scratchy Show needed an &quot; update &quot; to keep the interest of its audience, they devised Poochie, a cartoon dog &quot; with an attitude. &quot; After widespread auditions, Homer was chosen to provide Poochie&apos;s voice. The character debuted to an unimpressed audience following a massive publicity campaign; he only served to interfere with the well-oiled machine of hyperviolent slapstick that Itchy and Scratchy had perfected over the years. When dissatisfied viewers flooded the network with letters crying for Poochie&apos;s immediate removal, if not death, the executives quickly decided to get rid of the character. Homer begged for another chance, insisting that Poochie would grow on the audience; this argument held little weight until the actress who performed voices for both Itchy and Scratchy declared her support for Poochie as well. Homer was shocked, however, when the next cartoon aired: it contained a hastily-animated, retroscript ed segment stating that Poochie had decided to return to his &quot; home planet, &quot; and that he died when his spaceship crashed. He has since been seen once in a cameo at a funeral in an Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoon featured in Little Big Mom. Also in &quot; Treehouse of Horror IX, &quot; he skateboards in the road and gets run over by Scratchy driving a car. However he survives only to have his skateboard falling form the sky and hitting him in the head. He also continues to be released in Itchy &amp; Scratchy related merchandise such as on t-shirts in &quot; Fat Man and Little Boy &quot;. A matrix Poochie also appears in Kill Gil Vols. 1 &amp; 2 during the Krusty on ice show and a Poochie balloon appears in the cartoon in &quot; Funeral for a Fiend &quot;. Poochie reappears in The Simpsons Game as a boss on the Grand Theft Scratchy level. [ Princess Kashmir ] Princess Kashmir is the belly dance r who first appears in &quot; Homer&apos;s Night Out &quot; (and was the first woman who almost ruined Homer&apos;s marriage to Marge as Marge saw Homer dancing with her as a bad example for Bart in how to treat women). She dated Apu in &quot; Lisa&apos;s Pony, &quot; dated Apu&apos;s brother Sanjay on a few occasions, and is seen dancing with Chief Wiggum in the episode &quot; Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment &quot; (which also shocked and offended the women in town, much like what happened with Homer). She has also appeared in two couch gag s (the one on &quot; Marge vs. The Monorail, in which the Simpsons sit on the couch, followed by three rows of recurring extras and secondary characters, and the Sgt. Pepper album parody on &quot; Bart After Dark &quot; and the original airing of &quot; The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochy Show &quot; ), and is seen dancing on the stage in the Maison Derrière in the episode &quot; Bart After Dark &quot;. Her nickname is &apos;Queen of the Mysterious East&apos;. Her real name is Shauna Tifton, and also goes by April Flowers when performing in strip clubs. According to the DVD commentary for the season eight episode &quot; Bart After Dark, &quot; Princess Kashmir was originally going to be an actual bachelor party stripper on her premiere episode, but the FOX censors at the time objected (though they had no problem letting Princess Kashmir tell Bart that she works under the name &quot; April Flowers &quot; when she performs at strip clubs). [ Principal Dondelinger ] Harlan Dondelinger, voiced by Harry Shearer was Springfield High School&apos;s principal, first seen in the episode &quot; The Way We Was &quot;, a flashback to Homer and Marge &apos;s senior year in high school. He later appeared in the episode &quot; The Front &quot; at Homer and Marge&apos;s high school reunion and teaches night classes to ease the pain of his wife&apos;s recent death. He appeared in &quot; Half-Decent Proposal &quot; when Artie Ziff, Marge&apos;s high school prom date, recreated their prom. Dondelinger made his most recent appearance in the twentieth season episode &quot; Take My Life, Please &quot;. [ Rabbi Hyman Krustofski ] Hyman Krustofski is the father of Krusty the Clown. He first appeared in the third season episode &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot;. { Richmond, p. 103 } In this episode, in season fifteen &apos;s &quot; Today I Am a Clown &quot;, and season twenty-one &apos;s &quot; Once Upon a Time in Springfield &quot; he is voiced by comedian Jackie Mason (because in the three episodes, he was a major character, while in cameo speaking appearances, he is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. However, recent cameo speaking episodes have him again voiced by Jackie Mason). In &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot;, Rabbi Krustofski had been estranged from his son for twenty-five years. He disowned Krusty when the young man chose to become a clown when Krustofski had wanted him to follow the family tradition of becoming a rabbi. Years later, after much exchanging of Talmud passages between Bart Simpson and Rabbi Krustofski, Bart read the Rabbi a quote from Sammy Davis, Jr. admiring the Jews, which finally convinced Rabbi Krustofski to accept his son for his career in entertainment. He and Krusty reunited on the air of Krusty&apos;s show. The episode is a parody of the film The Jazz Singer. The parody was writer Jay Kogen &apos;s idea. [ Wolodarsky, Wallace The Simpsons The Complete Third Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] He thought it would be a funny parallel—and a chance to do a lot of easy jokes—if it were a clown instead of a singer who gets rejected by his father. [ Kogen, Jay The Simpsons The Complete Third Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] The character&apos;s casting was fitting in that the real-life Mason, like Krusty, also came from a family of rabbis but rejected his destiny in order to become a comedian. Jackie Mason won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance as Krustofsky in &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot; in 1992.

She is first seen in &quot; Alone Again, Natura-Diddily &quot;, when she befriends Ned Flanders after Maude ’s death. She appears towards the end of the episode singing the song &quot; He&apos;s the Man &quot; while the organist at the church was on a much needed vacation. The song was featured on The Simpsons: Testify. She returns in &quot; I&apos;m Goin&apos; to Praiseland &quot;. She stays at the Flanders&apos; house with Ned, and leaves briefly after Ned attempted to mold her in the image of his deceased wife Maude only to have her think Ned is using her and runs off. At the end of the episode, she returns and has a date with Flanders. She has not made an appearance since. [ Radioactive Man ] Radioactive Man is a fictional comic book superhero. The character was heavily featured in the episodes &quot; Three Men and a Comic Book &quot; and &quot; Radioactive Man &quot;. Within the Simpsons universe, he was created by Morty Mann. He has been portrayed in many media since his debut in Interesting Stories #27. { &quot; } { Moms I&apos;d Like to Forget &quot; } The first issue of Radioactive Man appeared in 1952. He was featured in at least one 1950s era black-and-white serial, sponsored by Laramie Cigarettes. { Mentioned in The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Three Men and a Comic Book &quot;. } There was also a camp y early 1970s television series resembling Batman. In one episode of The Simpsons, a Hollywood studio attempted to film a Radioactive Man movie in Springfield. The movie starred Rainier Wolfcastle as Radioactive Man. The role of Fallout Boy, Radioactive Man&apos;s sidekick, was cast from local children and went to Milhouse Van Houten. The movie was never completed due to budget overruns caused by constant price-gouging by Springfield vendors, and Milhouse snapping from the pressure of the role, and refusing to continue to portray Fallout Boy. { Season seven episode &quot; } { Radioactive Man &quot;. } Outside of The Simpsons, the Radioactive Man character also appeared in a real comic book series based on him that was first published by Bongo Comics in 1993. [ http://simpsons.ugo.com/?cur%3Dradioactive-man-comic%26amp%3Bgallery%3Dtrue Radioactive Man 2008-08-03 UGO Networks ] The Bongo comics expanded more on the character, including his powers, giving him several which parodied those of Superman including super speed, flight, and the power to fire beams of &quot; clean, nuclear heat &quot; from his eyes. The character has also appeared in issues of Simpsons Comics and Simpsons Super Spectacular, and in the 1992 video game Bartman Meets Radioactive Man. [ Mackey Bob Retro Revival Retrospective: The Simpsons Part 6 http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId%3D8991894 Retro Gaming Blog 1UP.com 2010-08-03 2009-05-31 ] [ Rainier Wolfcastle ] Rainier Luftwaffe Wolfcastle (voiced by Harry Shearer ) is an action hero star and a close parody of actor/bodybuilder/politician Arnold Schwarzenegger. { Jean, Al (2005). Commentary for &quot; } { A Star Is Burns &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } This basis has been drawn out over the series. Wolfcastle&apos;s wife is named Maria, just like the real Schwarzenegger&apos;s now separated wife Maria Shriver. Like Schwarzenegger, Wolfcastle is an active member of the Republican Party and owns a Hummer. In the episode &quot; The Boy Who Knew Too Much &quot;, Bart Simpson tells Wolfcastle that his &quot; last movie really sucked &quot; (Along with Chief Wiggum &apos;s line of &quot; &apos;Magic Ticket&apos; my ass, McBain! &quot; ), alluding to Schwarzenegger&apos;s film Last Action Hero, which was panned by critics. { Mirkin, David (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { The Boy Who Knew Too Much &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. Twentieth Century Fox. } Wolfcastle owns a restaurant named Planet Springfield, a parody of Planet Hollywood, which Schwarzenegger co-owned with other celebrities. [ Weinstein, Josh 2006 Commentary for &quot; My Sister, My Sitter &quot;. The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season DVD 20th Century Fox ] Wolfcastle has starred in many action movies, most notably the McBain series (a parody of action movies) and the movie of Radioactive Man. Rainier’s more recent movies have gained less renown, and he is even forced to do comedies and even standup comedy. Wolfcastle has made cameo appearances as an Academy Award presenter, a celebrity spokesperson, and a celebrity judge. In a recall election of Mayor Quimby, Wolfcastle ran for his seat. He has a daughter named Greta who had a crush on Bart in the episode &quot; The Bart Wants What It Wants &quot;. The writers invented Wolfcastle as the action hero McBain for the episode &quot; Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? &quot;. Because they liked the scene involving the character from that episode, they used him again in &quot; The Way We Was &quot;, which was recorded and aired before &quot; Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? &quot; The McBain films satirize clichés of action films. { Groening, Matt; Martin, Jeff; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The character was originally named McBain, until an actual film called McBain was released in 1991. That film&apos;s producers refused to allow the show to use the name, so &quot; Rainier Wolfcastle &quot; became the name of the actor playing the McBain role. { Groening, Matt; Brooks, James L.; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Silverman, David (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { The Way We Was &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson, doubles as Wolfcastle when Harry Shearer is absent from table reads. [ Rich Texan ] Colonel Antoine &quot; Tex &quot; O&apos;Hara, often referred to simply as the Rich Texan, voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is a stereotypical rich, callous but gregarious business owner. He is an active member of the Springfield Republican Party and speaks with a heavy Texas drawl. His morality can wildly vary from episode to episode; he can sometimes be selfish and sadistic, and at other times polite and friendly. He is based on the Texan oil tycoon character from Alfred Hitchcock &apos;s Psycho. [ August 2011 ] In the fifth season episode &quot; $pringfield &quot; (the Rich Texan&apos;s debut, though a similar character once appeared in the season two episode &quot; Old Money &quot; ), Homer addresses the Rich Texan as Senator, although this was never again referenced. Rich Texan sports a bolo tie and a white cowboy hat. He is also obsessive-compulsive, as revealed in &quot; The Seemingly Never-Ending Story &quot;. He has stated in &quot; Marge&apos;s Son Poisoning &quot; that he enjoys moonlit walks on the beach; in the same episode he held Homer and Moe at gunpoint while forcing them to walk along with him after being tricked by the two. He is well known for pulling out a pair of revolvers and firing them into the air while yelling &quot; Yee Haw! &quot; whenever he is happy or excited. He has a gay grandson, as revealed in &quot; Million Dollar Abie &quot; and a daughter named Paris Texan (who looks and acts like hotel heiress Paris Hilton ). In the episode &quot; Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Three Times &quot;, it is revealed that the Rich Texan is originally from Connecticut, despite his brash, stereotypically Southern persona. This is a reference to George W. Bush &apos;s Connecticut roots. [ Richard ] Richard is a gray-haired student at Springfield Elementary School and is one of Bart&apos;s good friends. He is first seen in &quot; Bart the Genius &quot;. He is usually seen with Lewis and has a leather jacket and a shirt with a small diamond embroidered on the center. Richard appears frequently in scenes involving the Springfield children, and in the early seasons was often involved with mischief. he&apos;s been voiced over the course of the series by Nancy Cartwright, Jo Ann Harris, Pamela Hayden, and Maggie Roswell. In early seasons he was commonly seen hanging out with Bart, Lewis, and Milhouse, but in recent years he is only seen in the classroom and in crowd scenes. He had a brief speaking part in &quot; The Haw-Hawed Couple &quot;, in which he was voiced by Pamela Hayden. His hair color changes from black to gray, to brown, and then to blue throughout the course of the show. However, in Simpsons Comics, his hair always appears gray. [ Rod Flanders ] Rod Flanders is voiced by Pamela Hayden. Rod is Ned Flanders&apos; 10 year old son. Rod prays often; first thing in the morning and last thing before bed. He prays for God to watch over him and his younger brother, Todd, as well as for the success of his father&apos;s business. He also prays for all of the other children like his neighbor Bart Simpson, who do not pray for themselves. Ned has described Rod&apos;s hobbies as including &quot; being quiet during trips, clapping with songs and diabetes &quot;. Rod&apos;s largest role was in &quot; Bart Has Two Mommies &quot;, where he obtains new climbing skills and rescues Bart from a chimpanzee atop a church. This episode also reveals that Rod thinks of Marge as the most fun he has had since his mother died. In &quot; &apos;Tis the Fifteenth Season, &quot; he mentions that he is &quot; jealous of girls &apos;cause they get to wear dresses, &quot; suggesting nascent transvestism. In a &quot; freeze-frame gag &quot; in the episode &quot; Homer Badman &quot;, Rod is stated to be the younger Flanders child. [ Ruth Powers ] Ruth Powers is the Simpsons &apos; next-door neighbor, introduced when she moves to their neighborhood in the episode &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot;. She is divorced and has a daughter, Laura Powers. According to &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot;, Ruth divorced her husband because his career got in the way with his family life, but in &quot; Marge on the Lam &quot;, Ruth tells Marge that all her husband ever did was &quot; eat, sleep, and drink beer &quot; and never gave her money for child support (which led to Ruth stealing her husband&apos;s convertible). She is usually seen as a background character, sometimes in events that occurred even before she moved next door (such as the baby shower for Maggie in &quot; And Maggie Makes Three &quot; ). She even continues to be a background character despite her later imprisonment. She nearly always wears a red headscarf. In the episode &quot; The Cartridge Family &quot; she was part of the NRA. She was voiced by Pamela Reed in her first two speaking appearances. David Mirkin said that Pamela Reed would always give great performances and that he does not know why they did not use her more. { Mirkin, David (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Marge on the Lam &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The episode &quot; Marge on the Lam &quot; features Ruth and Marge going on the run from the law in a stolen convertible, a parody of Thelma &amp; Louise. Ruth makes an appearance in the episode &quot; Strong Arms of the Ma &quot;, as a huge female bodybuilder, advising Marge (who is taking up weightlifting) to use steroid s. She reveals during her time in prison, she was &quot; Miss Mexican Mafia &quot;. In the episode &quot; The Bob Next Door &quot; Ruth moves away from Evergreen Terrace. [ Sam and Larry ] Sam and Larry, also known as &quot; Barfly #1 &quot; and &quot; Barfly #2 &quot;, are two regular patrons of Moe&apos;s Tavern. Their first appearance is in &quot; Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire &quot;. Virtually nothing is known about them, except that Sam always wears a cap and glasses and Larry has an orange jacket and a balding head and either looks extremely drunk or very depressed. Sam has spoken only a few times throughout the series; on the season three episode &quot; Lisa the Greek &quot;, Sam asks Homer who he bet on during the Super Bowl. In &quot; Worst Episode Ever &quot; Sam is shot in the back by Moe, for trying to pay in Sacagawea dollar s. Larry hasn&apos;t spoken, except for in fantasy sequences (in &quot; Marge Be Not Proud, &quot; Larry utters a garbled, &quot; Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year &quot; after Bart receives a soiled wig during Bart&apos;s image of spending Christmas in juvenile hall and in &quot; Simpson Tide, &quot; Larry grumbles, &quot; This stupid machine took my money! &quot; when Apu was thinking of his loved one -- in this case, his Kwik-E-Mart ciagrette machine that steals money and doesn&apos;t dispense cigarettes). [ Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon ] Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon ( Hindi ), voiced by Harry Shearer, is Apu Nahasapeemapetilon &apos;s younger half-brother and uncle of Apu&apos;s eight children. He has a daughter named Pahusacheta and a son named Jamshed. Sanjay has a wife, as he asked Apu to promise not to sleep with her if he dies (Apu&apos;s response to this request was a cheery &quot; I promise nothing! &quot; ). Sanjay was shown as Apu&apos;s business partner at the Kwik-E-Mart in the earlier episodes. His final speaking appearance was in I&apos;m with Cupid. However, he has appeared as a background character in Moe Letter Blues, Homer at the Bat (as pitcher for Fort Springfield), and The Simpsons Movie. [ Sarah Wiggum ] Sarah Wiggum (née Kanickee), voiced by Pamela Hayden. She is the gentle wife of Chief Wiggum and mother of Ralph Wiggum. She first appeared in the fourth season episode &quot; Duffless &quot;. { Groening, Matt (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Duffless &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Like Bernice Hibbert and Martha Quimby, she is one of the less notable characters who hardly ever speaks; however in The Simpsons Game she only ever says &quot; Clancy! &quot;, whether hit or in Marge&apos;s mob. In the episode, &quot; A Star Is Born-Again &quot;, at the Jellyfish Dance, Clancy mentions she was more beautiful at that moment than the day he arrested her, to which she giggles in reply. He then mentions he only planted the crystal meth on her so she would &quot; notice &quot; him. Sarah (according to Clancy) is his &quot; home force &quot; and he affectionately calls her &quot; Poppin&apos; Fresh &quot;. In the episode, &quot; Grade School Confidential &quot;, she immediately dials the authorities to Clancy&apos;s command. Ralph apparently gets his appearance from her, as the two look very similar. [ Scott Christian ] Scott Christian (voiced by Dan Castellaneta ) is a newsreader from the early seasons of the show. Originally, Christian and Kent Brockman shared the anchor desk equally, but eventually Brockman started to become the more commonly used anchor. In his final appearances, Christian was used mostly when Kent was in the field and an introduction was needed. His final speaking appearance was &quot; The Boy Who Knew Too Much &quot;. Christian was supposed to be permanent anchor, { Season 1 DVD Commentary - &quot; } { Krusty Gets Busted &quot; } always filling in for an absent Brockman, but was quickly phased out as the show progressed. He briefly appeared (with red colored hair) with the other Springfield celebrities in the season 18 episode &quot; Homerazzi &quot; and made a cameo in &quot; Guess Who&apos;s Coming to Criticize Dinner? &quot;. [ Sea Captain ] Captain McCallister (Horatio or Pete), more commonly known as &quot; The Sea Captain &quot;, voiced by Hank Azaria. Azaria modelled the voice on actor Robert Newton, who played pirates in several movies. { Azaria, Hank (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { New Kid on the Block &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } The writers&apos; &quot; love of sea talk &quot; is what inspired them to invent the Sea Captain. { Martin, Jeff (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { I Married Marge &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } His character is based on the stereotype of sailors and pirates, including the stereotypical pirate catchphrase, &quot; Yarr! &quot; He is a member of the Springfield Alcoholics Anonymous and has a peg leg in which he keeps liquor. In &quot; The Bart of War &quot; he uses his wooden leg to have a vicious sword fight with Sideshow Mel &apos;s bone. The Sea Captain is always seen holding a corncob pipe and squinting: because he has at least one glass eye - though once he was seen tapping both of his eyes and says he has &apos;two glass eyes.&apos; In addition to eye(s), he also has an artificial leg. As an entrepreneur, McCallister is equally incompetent. On several occasions, he acknowledges his incompetence with a depressed: &quot; Yarr, I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doin&apos;. &quot; Although he once states under oath (in &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot; ) that he is not a real sea captain, at various occasions in later episodes he is indeed shown captaining a ship. His restaurant, The Frying Dutchman, is a failing business venture that does not generate enough income to support its owner. During the episode &quot; Mr. Plow &quot;, the Captain pitches his 90 track sea shanties CD set in a commercial, which aired on Public-access television cable TV channel 92. In the episode &quot; Lisa Gets an &quot; A &quot; &quot;, the captain appears as a penniless bum. When seeing Homer and Marge walking Homer&apos;s pet lobster at the beach, he approaches them and claims that he runs a &quot; small academy for lobsters &quot;. However, when Marge refuses to send the lobster away to &quot; some snobby boarding school &quot;, McCallister asks her for spare change instead. His only main roles were in episodes &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot; and in &quot; The Wettest Stories Ever Told &quot;. In the former, Homer sues his restaurant The Frying Dutchman because they kicked him out at the restaurant&apos;s closing time before Homer had eaten all he could eat. In the latter, he cannot bring the Simpsons their food for numerous reasons like the &quot; chef having problems with tonight&apos;s special &quot;, which was an octopus. He then ignores the family while playing pickup basketball games with the restaurant&apos;s staff. [ Sherri and Terri ] Sherri and Terri, voiced by Russi Taylor, are identical twins with long purple hair and pale skin. They perpetually reinforce their identities as twins, with things such as making up their own &apos;twin&apos; language. They are in the same class as Bart at Springfield Elementary School. In &quot; Homer&apos;s Odyssey &quot; it is revealed that their father is Homer &apos;s supervisor at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He fires Homer for causing an accident while waving to Bart from a cart during a school tour of the plant. Homer, however, had the last laugh when he was promoted above the twins&apos; father to safety inspector. Their mother is shown in &quot; Bart Sells His Soul &quot; and looks just like her daughters. Sherri is two seconds older than Terri; { The Simpsons Game } they share their birthday with Rod Flanders. The girls themselves dress identically, reinforcing their &quot; twin-ness &quot;. They are quite snobbish, and never miss an opportunity to berate Bart. Bart appears to have a crush on one of them, as admitted in &quot; Hungry, Hungry Homer &quot;. Sherri referred to Bart as an ugly, smelly dork, but was persuaded by Homer to go on a date with Bart after he told her that she could not do much better. One of the twins stated that her sister had a crush on Bart in &quot; Bart Star &quot;. Another time, in &quot; Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder &quot;, Homer openly addressed Terri as &quot; the girl Bart has a crush on &quot;. In The Way We Weren&apos;t, they introduce a cousin who has a crush on Bart. In The Blue and the Gray it was revealed that they were actually conjoined triplets, and that the third triplet is seeking revenge. The third triplet is seen in The Daughter Also Rises, but they state it is probably an optical illusion. In &quot; Lisa&apos;s Substitute &quot;, they nominate Bart as the class president. [ Sideshow Mel ] Melvin Van Horne, better known as Sideshow Mel (voiced by Dan Castellaneta ), is Krusty the Clown &apos;s sidekick. He replaced Sideshow Bob after Bob was incarcerated for framing Krusty for armed robbery. Mel&apos;s hiring was never explicitly shown in the series and his full name was only revealed when he announced himself while trying to solve the mystery of who shot Mr. Burns in the episode &quot; Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two) &quot; and in the episode &quot; All About Lisa &quot; on the portrait of Sideshow Mel in the past. He first appeared in &quot; Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge &quot;, shortly after Sideshow Bob was sent to prison, filling the exact role that Bob once did. Little is known about Mel. He is a Cornell University graduate, and a former Gulp &apos;n Blow employee (during the time that Krusty&apos;s show was cancelled and Bart and Lisa set out to create a comeback special). Sideshow Mel is revealed, in the episode entitled &quot; All About Lisa &quot;, to have been the winner of the prestigious Springfield Entertainer of the Year award. The intoxication of applause made him reduce himself to ridiculous behavior for laughter, which he compared to doing heroin and checking email. Sideshow Mel uses a slide whistle to communicate on camera just like Bob. When not in character, Mel speaks in a grandiose English / Shakespeare an accent (Castellaneta&apos;s play on Kelsey Grammer &apos;s character, Sideshow Bob ) and owns poodles. When Springfield inhabitants form an angry mob, Mel often takes a leading role. Mel wears a bone in his hair that has been used as a weapon. In &quot; Homerazzi &quot; it was revealed that Mel was in a bitter custody battle and that he has a son, who looks just like him except without a bone in his hair. In &quot; I&apos;m with Cupid &quot;, he reveals he has a wife named Barbara, who appears in &quot; Realty Bites &quot; where they are bowling in a house that Marge tries to sell to them. She is revealed to be giving birth in the episode &quot; All About Lisa &quot;, suggesting that Mel has at least two children. She looks like a European woman, and has light hair. It has been suggested that Mel is very wealthy, able to afford betting thousands of dollars on football regularly. Sideshow Mel is often subject to abuse by Krusty, just as Sideshow Bob was before him. Such occurrences include &apos;Krusty&apos;s Slide&apos;, where he is forced into a mixture of pudding, pickle brine and laundry detergent, a tub of rancid Béarnaise sauce and a tub of refried beans; another unseen one is in &quot; Krusty Gets Kancelled &quot; where he states that Krusty once poured liquid nitrogen down his pants and cracked his buttocks with a hammer. In the episode &quot; Day of the Jackanapes &quot;, it is shown that Krusty can remember Sideshow Bob&apos;s name, but not Sideshow Mel&apos;s. [ Snake Jailbird ] Chester &quot; Snake &quot; Turley [ The Fool Monty The Fool Monty The Simpsons The Simpsons Price, Michael (writer); Moore, Steven Dean (director) Fox November 21, 2010 06 22 14:43 ], also known as Snake Jailbird, is voiced by Hank Azaria. { Richmond, p. 178 } A prominent antagonist in the series, he is Springfield &apos;s resident recidivist felon, consistently getting arrested for violent crimes but rarely appearing to stay in jail. He speaks with a &quot; Valley Boy &quot; accent. He is partial to fast cars and fast women, and has a knack for reckless abandon. He owned a car called Li&apos;l Bandit, which Homer won at a police auction (as seen in &quot; Realty Bites &quot; ). Snake first appeared in the season two episode &quot; The War of the Simpsons &quot; as one of the partygoers during Bart and Lisa&apos;s wild house party. Whenever Snake appears in prison, his prison number is always 7F20, the production code of &quot; The War of the Simpsons &quot;. Hank Azaria&apos;s voice for Snake was based on a roommate he had while in college. ) His name was first mentioned by Sideshow Bob in &quot; Black Widower &quot; when Sideshow Bob was saying goodbye to his prison friends after being granted parole. The character was originally named Jailbird. The animators assigned him to the role of Snake in season three &apos;s &quot; Black Widower &quot; and the character has gone by that name ever since. { Groening, Matt (2003). Commentary for &quot; } { Black Widower &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } In the episode &quot; The Seemingly Never-Ending Story &quot;, Lisa tells a story in which Snake refers to himself as Professor Jailbird, an Indiana Jones -like archeologist who turned to robbing convenience store s as revenge for the theft of valuable coins he had excavated. Snake attended Middlebury College, as he robs Moe&apos;s Tavern to pay off his student loans and is shown wearing a Middlebury shirt in &quot; 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot;. He also played lacrosse at Ball State University, according to &quot; Treehouse of Horror IX &quot;, [ http://www.snpp.com/episodes/3F18.html [3F18 &amp; #93; 22 Short Films About Springfield Snpp.com 2008-09-10 ], although it should be noted that the &quot; Treehouse &quot; episodes are considered non- canon. He has a casually hostile relationship with Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, whose convenience store he robs so frequently that Apu considers the continual robberies perfectly normal. Snake is often used as a cutaway foil for Apu; often, when Apu mentions his absence from the Kwik-E-Mart, Snake is shown robbing it, with various snide remarks. In the episode &quot; Marge in Chains &quot;, he literally &quot; shoplifts &quot;, stealing the entire Kwik-E-Mart shop via a flat-bed truck, declaring &quot; I&apos;m taking this baby to Mexico! &quot;. In &quot; Yokel Chords &quot;, he and Apu are seen in a psychiatrist&apos;s office, bickering about Snake&apos;s robberies and shootings in the manner of an unhappily married couple. Snake has a son named Jeremy, who looks just like him (who was introduced in &quot; Pygmoelian &quot; ) and likes to steal bicycles, a trait that Snake encourages. Unlike his father, Jeremy is rather timid as seen in The Seemingly Never-Ending Story. Snake has another child on the way; however, it has been implied he and the mother, Gloria, are no longer in a romantic relationship in the episode &quot; Homer and Lisa Exchange Crosswords &quot;. In the episode &quot; Wedding For Disaster &quot; Snake and Gloria are seen getting married at city hall. In the episode, &quot; Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes &quot;, he is seen with the pregnant Gloria driving a car. [ Squeaky-Voiced Teen ] Squeaky Voiced Teen, aka Pimple-Faced Teen, real name Jeremy Freedman (voiced by Dan Castellaneta ), { Gimple, p. 87 } is one of few teenagers on the show and is perpetually trapped in a series of dead-end jobs, usually working at Krusty Burger (as a cashier or, in the case of &quot; Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy &quot;, a supervisor in charge of training new employees), the grocery store (as a bagboy, as seen in &quot; Selma&apos;s Choice &quot; and &quot; Simpson Safari &quot; ), or at a movie theater (as either the ticket master, concession stand clerk, or usher ). The Squeaky Voiced Teen has acne, and his voice is in the process of breaking. The Squeaky Voiced Teen&apos;s personality is shy, pathetic, miserable, and awkward. He is often concerned about others and usually reports them to his boss; however, when he very rarely is the boss himself, he seizes opportunity and becomes stubborn and evil. Beginning with &quot; Team Homer &quot;, it is revealed that the Squeaky-Voiced Teen&apos;s mother is Lunchlady Doris (who disowns him after he mentions that he can&apos;t give a bowling lane to his own mother on League Night). Castellaneta lifted his voice for the character from actor Richard Crenna &apos;s as Walter Denton in the sitcom Our Miss Brooks. { Castellaneta, Dan (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Boy-Scoutz N the Hood &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Several different models of Squeaky-Voiced Teen have been used throughout the series, featuring counterparts in Mexico, Australia, and England. Steven Dean Moore uses them all as waiters at the ice cream parlor the Simpsons eat at in &quot; It&apos;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge &quot;. { Moore, Steven Dean (2008). Commentary for &quot; } { It&apos;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Matt Groening called Squeaky-Voiced Teen his second favorite &quot; unnamed &quot; character after Comic Book Guy, whose name was finally revealed to be &quot; Jeff Albertson &quot; in the episode &quot; Homer and Ned&apos;s Hail Mary Pass &quot;. { Groening, Matt (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Boy-Scoutz n the Hood &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Stampy ] Stampy is a male African elephant first appearing in the episode &quot; Bart Gets an Elephant &quot; (voiced by Frank Welker ). Bart wins the elephant in a radio contest called &quot; KBBL Is Gonna Gimme Something Stupid &quot;. As a prize, Bart was offered either an elephant or $10,000 in cash, with the elephant option as a joke. Bill and Marty had anticipated all winners would opt for the cash and were caught off guard when Bart chose the elephant. With the prospect of being fired looming, they eventually get Bart an elephant. Bart decides to name the elephant Stampy, who soon starts to cause trouble and costs a large amount of money in upkeep. Anxious to escape this, Homer offers Stampy to a wildlife reserve. However, on his realization that he will get nothing in return, he elects to sell Stampy to local poacher and ivory dealer, Mr. Blackheart. Homer later changes his mind after Stampy rescues him from a tar pit. Stampy likes peanut s and putting people in his mouth. He does not like other elephants, as can be seen when he is first introduced to the wildlife reserve. Stampy is alluded to in other episodes. At Apu&apos;s wedding, Bart sees Apu riding an elephant. Bart comments that he wishes that he had an elephant. Lisa responds, &quot; You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him. &quot; Bart simply replies, &quot; Oh, yeah. &quot; Stampy also appears in &quot; Miracle on Evergreen Terrace &quot; in Bart&apos;s water dream, and made a second (and more important) appearance on season 14&apos;s &quot; Large Marge &quot;, where he was involved in an attempt to restore the public opinion of Krusty the Clown. Stampy also attacks a bear in the final scene of &quot; The Fat and the Furriest &quot;, but then the bear fights back by hitting Stampy on the head with a club several times, much to Stampy&apos;s dismay. Stampy also appears in The Simpsons Movie, where he cracks the dome that covers Springfield, prompting the government&apos;s drastic action. [ State Comptroller Atkins ] State Comptroller Atkins, voiced by Hank Azaria, is the comptroller of Springfield&apos;s state. In &quot; Lisa Gets an &quot; A &quot; &quot; he is sent to deliver the basic assistance grant to Springfield Elementary after Lisa cheats on a test and raises the school&apos;s GPA up to the state&apos;s minimum requirement. Otto&apos;s impersonation of Atkins suggests that he is of Canadian origin. He appears later in &quot; Saddlesore Galactica &quot;, where he moderates the elementary school band competition at the state fair. He plans to give Lisa the unusually large good sportsmanship award until he hears her brand the first-place band &quot; cheaters &quot; for using glow-sticks in their performance. Atkins&apos; most recent appearance was in &quot; We&apos;re on the Road to D&apos;ohwhere &quot;, in which Superintendent Chalmers and Atkins are participating in a video conference with Skinner. He is also on Lisa&apos;s list of &quot; interesting adults &quot; in &quot; Moe&apos;N&apos;a Lisa &quot;. [ Superintendent Chalmers ] Superintendent Gary Chalmers, voiced by Hank Azaria, is the superintendent of Springfield&apos;s school district. He first appears in the episode &quot; Whacking Day &quot;. Chalmers is a strict and largely humorless man, with a short temper and low tolerance for disorder or rule-breaking; his general manner and personality are like those of a military officer. Whenever he visits Springfield Elementary, some sort of disaster strikes. He produces extreme anxiety in Principal Skinner, who offers increasingly improbable stories to explain what is happening. He is also known for seeming to be in complete disbelief of these improbable stories, but ultimately winds up actually believing them, teasing Skinner and the audience that he may actually take some action. Chalmers is known for throwing open the doors to the room and bellowing &quot; SKIN-NER!!! &quot; or &quot; SEY-MOUR!!! &quot;, to which Seymour stammers &quot; S-Superintendent Chalmers! &quot;. His catchphrase has caused some paranoia in Skinner (as seen in &quot; Lisa&apos;s Date with Density &quot; ). On a few occasions, he says Skinner&apos;s name this way when absolutely nothing has gone wrong, implying that he either pronounces Skinner&apos;s name this way by habit, or does it on purpose to scare him. In Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words, he even pronounces the words &quot; skimmer &quot; and &quot; dinner &quot; in a similar manner to Skinner&apos;s name, who mistakes it as Chalmers wanting his attention. However, Chalmers does on at least two occasions show a fondness for Skinner. In &quot; The Debarted &quot;, both Skinner and Chalmers are lost in the foam of a massive explosion resulting from the mixture of Mentos and Diet Coke, he screams Skinner&apos;s name and upon not receiving an answer, says it again in a softer manner. Skinner then replies to which Chalmers tells him in a frightened voice, &quot; Don&apos;t ever scare me like that again. &quot; More notable, in How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?, when Edna uses a pigeon to taunt Skinner about how much better her life is without him, Chalmers shows compassion for Skinner and even offers his friendship, but unfortunately, Edna reveals that she had an affair with Chalmers, leaving Skinner angry and forcing Chalmers to flee. In &quot; Lisa Simpson, This Isn&apos;t Your Life &quot;, it is revealed that Chalmers has nothing personal against Skinner and that he is aware that the antics within the school are a result of the students&apos; reckless nature and the teachers&apos; indifference, but he can only scold Skinner because he would have to face the ire of the parents or of the Teachers&apos; union if he tries to chastise any group. Chalmers&apos; own competence and dedication to his job are questionable. He lets Ned Flanders allow the school to descend into anarchy when he (Flanders) is principal, freely admitting that he had fired Skinner for far less, explaining simply that &quot; Skinner really bugged me. &quot; He seems disturbingly unconcerned with the school&apos;s decline, saying that &quot; the way America&apos;s public schools are sliding, they&apos;ll all be like this in a matter of months. I say enjoy it — it&apos;s a hell of a toboggan ride! &quot; He also promotes people based on personal bias as opposed to actual competence, promoting Principal Holloway, described by Skinner as a &quot; drunk &quot; and by Chalmers as a &quot; pill-popper &quot;, to assistant superintendent, overlooking the efforts made by Skinner to improve his school&apos;s standing. In the episode &quot; 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot;, he mentions he is from Utica, New York. He has also mentioned that he attended Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. In several episodes, such as &quot; Bart the Fink &quot;, Chalmers is seen dating Agnes Skinner (much to Seymour&apos;s chagrin), although in other episodes, he mentions he is married. His first name is revealed to be Gary in &quot; Yokel Chords &quot; and in &quot; Wild Barts Can&apos;t Be Broken &quot;, and it is revealed that he is a Spanish immigrant Señor Chalmers. In the DVD commentaries to &quot; 22 Short Films About Springfield &quot; and &quot; Grade School Confidential &quot;, it is noted that Superintendent Chalmers seems to be one of the few &quot; normal &quot; characters on the show and is frequently alone in his awareness of the show&apos;s zaniness. In &quot; Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts &quot;, Chalmers indicates that he had a wife that has since died. In the episode &quot; Replaceable You &quot; it is suggested, by Dolph&apos;s science fair project, the toupee detector, that Chalmers wears a wig. The first episode in which he was a main character was Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts, in which he takes over the Elementary School&apos;s Boys. He is fired for allowing Nelson to fall of a cliff, but is reinstated to Super-Duper Intendent after Bart takes over the school. [ Tina Ballerina ] Tina is a cast member on the Krusty the Klown Show and is a heavyset ballerina, most probably used for comedy purposes. Her first appearance was in the episode &quot; Like Father, Like Clown &quot;. [ Todd Flanders ] Todd Flanders is Ned Flanders&apos; eight year old son, voiced by Nancy Cartwright. His voice is based on Sherman&apos;s from Peabody and Sherman. Todd is the most impressionable member of the Flanders family. When exposed to profanity, he himself starts to curse ( &quot; Hell, no &quot; and &quot; I said I don&apos;t want any damn vegetables &quot; ). When Moe Szyslak loses his temper at Uncle Moe&apos;s Family Feedbag restaurant, Todd responds with &quot; Ow, my freaking ears! &quot; Whether due to immaturity or relentless sheltering by his parents, whenever Todd comes into contact with anything outside his family and their pious ways, such as the time he was tricked into eating a Pixy Stix by Bart Simpson, he turns aggressive, telling his brother to &quot; go to hell zitface &quot;, much to the delight of Bart. Todd can play the violin quite well, and is a part of the Springfield Elementary School band. He also plays mini golf quite well. [ Üter Zörker ] Üter Zörker, [ Üter ] voiced by Russi Taylor, is an overweight German foreign exchange student with a sweet tooth, and odd habits such as offering his already-licked lollipops to others as a sign of friendship, and eating marzipan candies (called Joy Joy) fortified with iodine. He was left behind on the Civil War field trip, according to the season six episode &quot; The PTA Disbands &quot;. His subsequent disappearance from the show for a significant period of time has become a running joke. In &quot; Guess Who&apos;s Coming to Criticize Dinner? &quot; his parents asked Skinner where their missing son was, and in &quot; 24 Minutes &quot; he is seen stuck in a cobweb in the school air vents. It is revealed in the episode &quot; Jazzy and the Pussycats &quot; that he can play the trumpet quite well. He even makes a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory diorama, but eats it before it can be graded in &quot; Lisa&apos;s Rival &quot;. During the school science fair in the season 23 episode &quot; Replaceable You &quot; Kearney has a human skull on display questioning &quot; Is This Üter? &quot; In the German dub of the show, Üter is an exchange student from Switzerland. [ Vanderbilts ] A rich couple who are frequently shocked by Homer&apos;s antics. They first appear in Saddlesore Galactica where Mr Vanderbilt breaks his monocle after being shocked. This gag is reused in A Tale of Two Springfields. In Homer vs. Dignity Mrs Vanderbilt is shocked by Homer Simpson &apos;s antics twice. In The Frying Game, Mrs Vanderbilt is shown as friends with Mrs. Bellamy, Mrs. Glick and Agnes Skinner. They are a parody of the actual Vanderbilt family. [ Wendell Borton ] Wendell Borton is a perpetually nauseated and very pale boy with worried eyes and curly hair. He first appears in &quot; Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire &quot; although his first speaking appearance is in &quot; Homer&apos;s Odyssey &quot;. He becomes especially sick on field trip s, with a tendency to become even paler than usual. He makes frequent appearances at the school nurse&apos;s office at Springfield Elementary School. A classmate of Bart Simpson, Wendell is most often seen with classmates Richard, Lewis, and Martin. He voted for Martin Prince, thus making Bart lose in the class election, and ensuring Martin&apos;s victory. He is one of the few characters (like Bart, Lisa, and Maggie) whose hair is the same color as his skin. Throughout the series, Wendell has been voiced by Jo Ann Harris, Pamela Hayden, Nancy Cartwright, and Russi Taylor. [ Mr. and Mrs. Winfield ] The Winfields are an elderly couple who live next door to the Simpson family early in the series and often talk about how crude and uncivilized the family is. They first appear in the season one episode &quot; Homer&apos;s Odyssey &quot;, cracking jokes about Homer. The couple eventually move to Florida in the season four episode &quot; New Kid on the Block &quot; and have not been seen since. The couple appear in the season two episodes &quot; Simpson and Delilah &quot; and &quot; Bart&apos;s Dog Gets an F &quot;, in which the wife is revealed to be named Sylvia. She also has a small speaking role in the Season 3 episode Separate Vocations when she mistakenly thinks Bart is being arrested by the Springfield police. The couple appear in the pre-2009 opening credits of The Simpsons, during the segment where Marge and Maggie pass many characters while driving home. Matt Groening named the Winfields after friends of his. { Groening, Matt (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { The War of the Simpsons &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } [ Wiseguy ] Raphael, a.k.a. Wiseguy, is voiced by Hank Azaria. He first appeared as the chauffeur in the second season in &quot; The Way We Was &quot;, but he has held numerous other jobs in the series. { Silverman, David (2002). Commentary for &quot; } { Old Money &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Simpsons sound editor Bob Beecher commented on alt.tv.simpsons that, &quot; He doesn&apos;t have one name. His character&apos;s name always fits the scene so he&apos;s gone by many names, &apos;Clerk&apos;, &apos;Shopkeeper&apos;, etc. But in the script the direction given to the voice is &apos;Wiseguy Voice&apos;. So call him &apos;Wiseguy&apos; if you want. &quot; [ http://snpp.com/guides/smam.file.html The Sarcastic Middle-Aged Man File The Simpsons Archive 2008-09-10 ] Azaria does a Charles Bronson -impression for the voice. { Azaria, Hank (2004). Commentary for &quot; } { Homer&apos;s Barbershop Quartet &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } In &quot; Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious &quot;, Al Jean and Mike Reiss had Azaria voice a Simpsonized Charles Bronson as a reference to this. { Jean, Al (2006). Commentary for &quot; } { Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious &quot;, in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. } Wiseguy has been dubbed &quot; The Sarcastic Middle-Aged Man &quot; by the show&apos;s Internet fans. { Turner, p. 165 } In &quot; Day of the Jackanapes &quot;, Sideshow Bob calls Wiseguy by the name &quot; Raphael &quot;. { McCann, p. } [ Yes Guy ] The Frank Nelson Type, { McCann, p. 54 } also known as &quot; The Yes Guy &quot;, is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. { McCann, p. 116 } He first appeared in season ten &apos;s episode &quot; Mayored to the Mob &quot; as the maître d΄ at the Springfield Dinner Theater. He is a character known for bellowing &quot; Ye-e-e-s?! &quot; in a falling, then rising intonation, and appears to be highly eccentric in both his speech and appearance. The Yes Guy is a tribute to the recurring Frank Nelson character from The Jack Benny Program, I Love Lucy, and Sanford and Son, whose trademark greeting in all his characters was a loud, drawn-out &quot; Ye-e-e-s?! &quot; Inexplicably, the original character could always be found working behind the service counter of whatever shop Benny or Fred Sanford might be patronizing, and his Simpsonian counterpart is similar. In the Yes Guy&apos;s first appearance, Homer asks why his voice is always stretched, and the Yes Guy replies by saying &quot; I had a stro-o-o-oke &quot;. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Mayored to the Mob &quot; } He also appears in &quot; Homer vs. Dignity &quot;. He works at Costington&apos;s department store, { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { Milhouse Doesn&apos;t Live Here Anymore &quot; } works as juror number twelve of the Springfield Panel of Jury, { The Simpsons episode: &quot; } { The Monkey Suit &quot; } and as an executioner at Springfield Penitentiary. { The Simpsons episode &quot; } { The Frying Game &quot; } Homer refers to him as &quot; that jerk who always goes Yessss &quot;. { The Simpsons episode: &quot; } { Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays &quot; } A Brazilian version of him was seen in &quot; Blame It on Lisa &quot;, uttering &quot; Si-i-i-m?! &quot; ( &quot; Yes &quot; in Portuguese).

The invasion phase consisted of a conventionally fought war which concluded with the capture of the Iraq capital Baghdad by United States forces. Four countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. These were the United States (148,000), United Kingdom (45,000), Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). 36 other countries were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in Kuwait by 18 February.

According to U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the coalition mission was &quot; to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein&apos;s support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people. &quot; Former chief counter-terrorism adviser on the National Security Council Richard A.

The following day coalition forces launched an incursion into Basra Province from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March the 173rd Airborne Brigade was airdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk where they joined forces with Kurdish rebels and fought several actions against the Iraqi army to secure the northern part of the country. The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the military occupation period. As of December 2011, the 2003 invasion of Iraq was the most recent armed conflict between standing national armies causing at least 1,000 battle deaths. [ Goldstein Joshua S.

It was revealed that a biological weapons (BW) program in Iraq had begun in the early 1980s with help from the United States and Britain [ October 2011 ], in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972. Details of the BW program—along with a chemical weapons program—surfaced in the wake of the Gulf War (1990–91) following investigations conducted by the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) which had been charged with the post-war disarmament of Saddam&apos;s Iraq. The investigation concluded that there was no evidence the program had continued after the war. The U.S. and its allies then maintained a policy of “ containment ” towards Iraq. This policy involved numerous economic sanctions by the UN Security Council; U.S. and UK enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones declared by the U.S. and the UK to protect Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and Shia s in the south from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government during the 1991 uprisings; and ongoing inspections.

The Republican Party&apos;s campaign platform in the 2000 election called for &quot; full implementation &quot; of the Iraq Liberation Act and removal of Hussein.

Once on the ground, they prepared for the subsequent arrival of U.S. Army Special Forces to organize the Kurdish Peshmerga. This joint team (called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element (NILE)) { Plan of Attack, Bob Woodward, Simon and Shuster, 2004. } combined to defeat Ansar al-Islam, a group with ties to al-Qaeda, in Iraqi Kurdistan. This battle was for control of the territory that was occupied by Ansar al-Islam and took place before the invasion. It was carried out by Paramilitary Operations Officers from SAD and the Army&apos;s 10th Special Forces Group. This battle resulted in the defeat of Ansar and the capture of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war.

These missions led to the initial air strike s against Hussein and his generals. Although the strike against Hussein was unsuccessful in killing him, it effectively ended his ability to command and control his forces. Strikes against Iraq&apos;s generals were more successful and significantly degraded the Iraqi command&apos;s ability to react to, and maneuver against the US-led invasion force. { Behind lines, an unseen war, Faye Bowers, Christian Science Monitor, April 2003. } SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi Army officers into surrendering their units once the fighting started. NATO member Turkey refused to allow the U.S. forces across its territory into northern Iraq. Therefore, joint SAD and Army Special forces teams and the Pershmerga were the entire Northern force against the Iraqi army. They managed to keep the northern divisions in place rather than allowing them to aid their colleagues against the U.S.-led coalition force coming from the south.

Obeidi told Hage that Baghdad did not understand why they were being targeted, and that they had no WMDs. He then made the offer for Washington to send in 2000 FBI agents to confirm this. He additionally offered petroleum concessions, but stopped short of having Hussein give up power, instead suggesting that elections could be held in two years. Later, Obeidi suggested that Hage travel to Baghdad for talks; he accepted. Later that month, Hage met with General Habbush and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. He was offered top priority to U.S. firms in oil and mining rights, UN-supervised elections, U.S. inspections (with up to 5,000 inspectors), to have al-Qaeda agent Abdul Rahman Yasin (in Iraqi custody since 1994) handed over as a sign of good faith, and to give &quot; full support for any U.S. plan &quot; in the Arab-Israeli peace process.

As the Christian Science Monitor observed at the time, while &quot; Sources knowledgeable about U.S. intelligence say there is no evidence that Hussein played a role in the 11 Sept. attacks, nor that he has been or is currently aiding Al Qaeda... the White House appears to be encouraging this false impression, as it seeks to maintain American support for a possible war against Iraq and demonstrate seriousness of purpose to Hussein&apos;s regime. &quot; The CSM went on to report that, while polling data collected &quot; right after 11 Sept. 2001 &quot; showed that only 3 percent mentioned Iraq or Saddam Hussein, by January 2003 attitudes &quot; had been transformed &quot; with a Knight Ridder poll showing that 44% of Americans believed &quot; most &quot; or &quot; some &quot; of the 11 September hijackers were Iraqi citizens.

Security Council all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq &quot; and &quot; obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq. &quot; The resolution authorized President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States &quot; as he determines to be necessary and appropriate &quot; to &quot; defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq. &quot; The legality of the invasion of Iraq has been challenged since its inception on a number of fronts, and several prominent supporters of the invasion in all the invading nations have publicly and privately cast doubt on its legality.

The most relevant to this issue is Resolution 678, passed on 29 November 1990. It authorizes &quot; member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait... to use all necessary means &quot; to (1) implement Security Council Resolution 660 and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraq&apos;s occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) &quot; restore international peace and security in the area. &quot; Resolution 678 has not been rescinded or nullified by succeeding resolutions and Iraq was not alleged after 1991 to invade Kuwait or to threaten do so. Resolution 1441 was most prominent during the run up to the war and formed the main backdrop for Secretary of State Colin Powell &apos;s address to the Security Council one month before the invasion. { Transcript of Powell&apos;s U.N.

Under this reasoning, by failing to disarm and submit to weapons inspections, Iraq was in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 660 and 678, and the U.S. could legally compel Iraq&apos;s compliance through military means. Critics and proponents of the legal rationale based on the U.N. resolutions argue that the legal right to determine how to enforce its resolutions lies with the Security Council alone, not with individual nations. In February 2006, Luis Moreno Ocampo, the lead prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, reported that he had received 240 separate communications regarding the legality of the war, many of which concerned British participation in the invasion. { Richard Norton-Taylor International court hears anti-war claims in } { The Guardian 6 May 2005. } In a letter addressed to the complainants, Mr. Moreno Ocampo explained that he could only consider issues related to conduct during the war and not to its underlying legality as a possible crime of aggression because no provision had yet been adopted which &quot; defines the crime and sets out the conditions under which the Court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to it. &quot; In a March 2007 interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Moreno Ocampo encouraged Iraq to sign up with the court so that it could bring cases related to alleged war crimes. { Chamberlin, Gethin. &quot; Court &apos;can envisage&apos; Blair prosecution &quot;.

Once on the ground they prepared for the subsequent arrival of US military forces. SAD teams then combined with US Army Special Forces to organize the Kurdish Peshmerga. This joint team combined to defeat Ansar al-Islam, an ally of Al Qaida, in a battle in the northeast corner of Iraq. The US side was carried out by Paramilitary Officers from SAD and the Army&apos;s 10th Special Forces Group. SAD teams also conducted high risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions led to the initial strikes against Saddam Hussein and his key generals. Although the initial strikes against Hussein were unsuccessful in killing the dictator or his generals, it was successful in effectively ending the ability to command and control Iraqi forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command&apos;s ability to react to and maneuver against the US-led invasion force coming from the south. SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started and/or not to oppose the invasion force. NATO member Turkey refused to allow its territory to be used for the invasion. As a result, the SAD/SOG and US Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga were the entire northern force against government forces during the invasion. Their efforts kept the 5th Corps of the Iraqi army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than their moving to contest the coalition force. According to General Tommy Franks, April Fool, an American officer working undercover as a diplomat, was approached by an Iraqi intelligence agent. April Fool then sold to the Iraqi false &quot; top secret &quot; invasion plans provided by Franks&apos; team. This decoy deception successfully misled the Iraqi military into deploying major forces in Northern and Western Iraq in anticipation of attacks by way of Turkey or Jordan, which never took place. This greatly reduced the defensive capacity in the rest of Iraq and significantly facilitated the actual attacks via Kuwait and the Persian Gulf in the southeast.

In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to decapitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see Shock and Awe ), attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The assumption was that superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces would allow them to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions. Following Turkey &apos;s decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south. { Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq, Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press. } Special Operations forces from the CIA and US Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in Kuwait and other Persian Gulf nations. One result of this was that one of the divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable to take part in the invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations. { NASA } { Landsat 7 image of } { Baghdad, 2 April 2003.

The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had set many oil wells on fire in an attempt to disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi forces had mined some 400 oil wells around Basra and the Al-Faw peninsula with explosives. Coalition troops launched an air and amphibious assault on the Al-Faw peninsula during the closing hours of 19 March to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the Royal Navy, Polish Navy, and Royal Australian Navy.

There they met with heavy resistance by Iraqi troops. A total of 14 Coalition troops and 30–40 Iraqi troops were killed, and 450 Iraqis taken prisoner. The British Army &apos;s 16 Air Assault Brigade also secured the oil fields in southern Iraq in places like Rumaila while the Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction. Despite the rapid advance of the invasion forces, some 44 oil wells were destroyed and set ablaze by Iraqi explosives or by incidental fire. However, the wells were quickly capped and the fires put out, preventing the ecological damage and loss of oil production capacity that had occurred at the end of the Gulf War. In keeping with the rapid advance plan, the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force moved along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and 1 (UK) Armoured Division moved northward through the eastern marshland. During the first week of the war, Iraqi forces fired a Scud missile at the American Battlefield Update Assessment center in Camp Doha, Kuwait. The missile was intercepted and shot down by a Patriot missile seconds before hitting the complex. Subsequently, two A-10 Warthog s bombed the missile launcher. [ Battle of Nasiriyah ] [ Battle of Nasiriyah ] Initially, the U.S. 1st Marine Division fought through the Rumaila oil field s, and moved north to Nasiriyah —a moderate-sized, Shi&apos;ite dominated city with important strategic significance as a major road junction and its proximity to nearby Talil Airfield. It was also situated near a number of strategically important bridges over the Euphrates River. The city was defended by a mix of regular Iraqi army units, Ba&apos;ath loyalists, and Fedayeen from both Iraq and abroad. The United States Army 3rd Infantry Division defeated Iraqi forces entrenched in and around the airfield and bypassed the city to the west. A U.S. amphibious fighting vehicle destroyed near Nasiriyah On 23 March, a convoy from the 3rd Infantry Division, including the female American soldiers Jessica Lynch and Lori Piestewa, was ambushed after taking a wrong turn into the city. Eleven U.S. soldiers were killed, and seven, including Lynch and Piestewa, were captured.

Piestewa, who was from Tuba City, Arizona, and an enrolled member of the Hopi Tribe, was believed to have been the first Native American woman killed in combat in a foreign war. On the same day, U.S Marines from the Second Marine Division entered Nasiriyah in force, facing heavy resistance as they moved to secure two major bridges in the city. Several Marines were killed during a firefight with Fedayeen in the urban fighting. At the Saddam Canal, another 18 Marines were killed in heavy fighting with Iraqi soldiers. An Air Force A-10 was involved in a case of friendly fire that resulted in the death of six Marines when it accidentally attacked an American amphibious vehicle. Two other vehicles were destroyed when a barrage of RPG and small arms fire killed most of the Marines inside.

The bridges were secured and the Second Marine division set up an perimeter around the city. { Rumaila oil field, April 2, 2003 } On the evening of 24 March, a battalion of the 1st Marine Regiment pushed through Nasiriyah and established a perimeter 15  kilometers (9.3  miles) north of the city. Iraqi reinforcements from Kut launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200–300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi Fedayeen continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights in which large numbers of Fedayeen were killed. Because of Nasiriyah&apos;s strategic position as a road junction, a significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the city&apos;s surrounding highways. With the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured, Coalition forces gained an important logistical center in southern Iraq and established FOB/EAF Jalibah, some [ 10 mi km ] outside of Nasiriyah. Additional troops and supplies were soon brought through this forward operating base. The 101st Airborne Division continued its attack north in support of the 3rd Infantry Division. By 28 March, a severe sand storm slowed the Coalition advance as the 3rd Infantry Division halted its northward drive half way between Najaf and Karbala. As a result of heavy rains that occurred along with the sand storm, orange-colored mud fell on some parts of the invasion force in the area. Air operations by helicopters, poised to bring reinforcements from the 101st Airborne, were blocked for three days. There was particularly heavy fighting in and around the bridge near the town of Kufl. [ Battle of Najaf ] [ Battle of Najaf (2003) ] { Najaf } Another fierce battle was at Najaf, where U.S. airborne and armored units with British air support fought an intense battle with Iraqi Regulars, Republican Guard units, and paramilitary forces. It started with U.S. AH-64 Apache helicopter gunships setting out on a mission to attack Republican Guard armored units, and while flying low, came under heavy anti-aircraft, small arms, and RPG fire which disrupted the attack and led to one of the gunships down and many heavily damaged.

A joint Polish-British-American force ran into unexpectedly stiff resistance, and it took several days to clear the Iraqi forces out. Farther north, the British 7 Armoured Brigade ( &quot; The Desert Rats &quot; ), fought their way into Iraq&apos;s second-largest city, Basra, on 6 April, coming under constant attack by regulars and Fedayeen, while 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (the British Red Devils ) cleared the &apos;old quarter&apos; of the city that was inaccessible to vehicles. Entering Basra was achieved after two weeks of fierce fighting, which included the biggest tank battle by British forces since World War II when the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks on 27 March. Elements of 1 (UK) Armoured Division began to advance north towards U.S. positions around Al Amarah on 9 April. Pre-existing electrical and water shortages continued throughout the conflict and looting began as Iraqi forces collapsed. While Coalition forces began working with local Iraqi Police to enforce order, a joint team composed of Royal Engineers and the Royal Logistics Corps of the British Army rapidly set up and repaired dockyard facilities to allow humanitarian aid to begin to arrive from ships arriving in the port city of Umm Qasr. After a rapid initial advance, the first major pause occurred near Karbala. There, U.S. Army elements met resistance from Iraqi troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north. Eventually, troops from the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S Army secured the cities of Najaf and Karbala to prevent any Iraqi counterattacks on the 3rd Infantry Division&apos;s lines of communication as the division pressed its advance toward Baghdad. A total of 11 British soldiers were killed, while 395–515 Iraqi soldiers, irregulars, and Fedayeen were killed. [ Battle of Karbala ] [ Battle of Karbala (2003) ] Mural of Saddam Hussein vandalized in Karabala, April 2003. The Karbala Gap was a 20-25-mile wide strip of land with the Euphrates River to the east and Lake Razazah to the west. This strip of land was recognized by Iraqi commanders as a key approach to Baghdad, and was defended by some of the best units of the Iraqi Republican Guard. The Iraqi high command had originally positioned two Republican Guard divisions blocking the Karbala Gap.

However, the Coalition had since the beginning of March been conducting a strategic deception operation to convince the Iraqis that the U.S. 4th Infantry Division would be mounting a major assault into northern Iraq from Turkey. [ http://www.jewishworldreview.com/michael/kelly1.asp#3.%20Across The Euphrates &amp; #124; Michael Kelly Jewishworldreview.com 3 April 2003 15 January 2011 ] This deception plan worked, and on 2 April Saddam&apos;s son Qusay Hussein declared that the American invasion from the south was a feint and ordered troops to be re-deployed from the Karbala front to the north of Baghdad. Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was in command of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib. At Musayib, U.S. troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time. The 10th Armored Brigade from the Medina Division and the 22nd Armored Brigade from the Nebuchadnezzar Division, supported by artillery, launched night attacks against the U.S. bridgehead at Musayib. The attack was repulsed using tank fire and massed artillery rockets, destroying or disabling every Iraqi tank in the assault. The next morning, Coalition aircraft and helicopters fired on the Republican Guard units, destroying many more vehicles as well as communications infrastructure. The Republican Guard units broke under the massed firepower and lost any sense of command and cohesion and the U.S. forces poured through gap on to Baghdad. [ Special operations ] The northern front during March and April 2003 The 2nd Battalion of the U.S. 5th Special Forces Group, United States Army Special Forces (Green Berets) conducted reconnaissance in the cities of Basra, Karbala and various other locations. In the North, the 10th Special Forces Group (10th SFG) and CIA paramilitary officers from their Special Activities Division had the mission of aiding the Kurdish parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, de facto rulers of Iraqi Kurdistan since 1991, and employing them against the 13 Iraqi Divisions located near Kirkuk and Mosul. Turkey had officially prohibited any Coalition troops from using their bases or airspace, so lead elements of the 10th SFG had to make a detour infiltration; their flight was supposed to take four hours but instead took ten. Hours after the first of such flights, Turkey did allow the use of its air space and the rest of the 10th SFG infiltrated in. The preliminary mission was to destroy the base of the Kurdish terrorist group Ansar al-Islam, believed to be linked to al-Qaeda. Concurrent and follow-on missions involved attacking and fixing Iraqi forces in the north, thus preventing their deployment to the southern front and the main effort of the invasion. On 26 March 2003, the 173rd Airborne Brigade augmented the invasion&apos;s northern front by parachuting into northern Iraq onto Bashur Airfield, controlled at the time by elements of 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga. The fall of Kirkuk on 10 April 2003 to the 10th SFG, CIA Paramilitary Teams and Kurdish peshmerga precipitated the 173rd&apos;s planned assault, preventing the unit&apos;s involvement in combat against Iraqi forces during the invasion. The successful occupation of Kirkuk came as a result of approximately two weeks of fighting that included the Battle of the Green Line (the unofficial border of the Kurdish autonomous zone) and the subsequent Battle of Kani Domlan Ridge (the ridgeline running northwest to southeast of Kirkuk), the latter fought exclusively by 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga against the Iraqi I Corps. The 173rd Brigade would eventually take responsibility for Kirkuk days later, becoming involved in the counterinsurgency fight and remain there until redeploying a year later. Further reinforcing operations in Northern Iraq, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), serving as Landing Force Sixth Fleet, deployed in April to Erbil and subsequently Mosul via Marine KC-130 flights. The 26 MEU (SOC) maintained security of the Mosul airfield and surrounding area until relief by the 101st Airborne Division. After Sargat was taken, Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and CIA paramilitary officers along with their Kurdish allies pushed south towards Tikrit and the surrounding towns of Northern Iraq. Previously, during the Battle of the Green Line, Bravo Company, 3/10 with their Kurdish allies pushed back, destroyed, or routed the 13th Iraqi Infantry Division. The same company took Tikrit. Iraq was the largest deployment of the U.S. Special Forces since Vietnam. [ Fall of Baghdad (April 2003) ] [ Battle of Baghdad (2003) ] A T72 &apos;&apos;Asad Babil&apos;&apos; abandoned after facing the final U.S. thrust into Baghdad An American M1 Abrams tank destroyed in Baghdad Three weeks into the invasion, US-led Coalition forces moved into Baghdad. Units of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard led the defence of the city. The rest of the defenders were a mixture of Republican Guard units, regular army units, Fedayeen Saddam, and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces. This plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guard&apos;s assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. On 5 April, Task Force 1–64 Armor of the U.S. Army&apos;s 3rd Infantry Division executed a raid, later called the &quot; Thunder Run &quot;, to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 Bradley armored fighting vehicles advancing to the Baghdad airport. They met heavy resistance, but were successful in reaching the airport. U.S. troops faced heavy fighting in the airport, and were even temporarily pushed out, but eventually secured the airport. { 1st Battalion 7th Marines enter a palace during the } { Battle of Baghdad } The next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division attacked into downtown Baghdad and occupied one of the palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown. On 10 April, a rumor emerged that Saddam Hussein and his top aides were in a mosque complex in the Al Az&apos;Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three companies of Marines were sent to capture him and came under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed. { toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue in } { Firdos Square in Baghdad shortly after the } { capture of the city } Many Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his cult of personality. One widely publicized event was the dramatic toppling of a large statue of Saddam in Baghdad&apos;s Firdos Square. This attracted considerable media coverage at the time. As the British Daily Mirror reported, &quot; For an oppressed people this final act in the fading daylight, the wrenching down of this ghastly symbol of the regime, is their Berlin Wall moment. Big Moustache has had his day. &quot; { Anton Antonowicz, ‘Toppling Saddam&apos;s Statue Is The Final Triumph For These Oppressed People’ in The Mirror, 10 April 2003. } As Staff Sergeant Brian Plesich reported in On Point: The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom, &quot; The Marine Corps colonel in the area saw the Saddam statue as a target of opportunity and decided that the statue must come down.

Gregory Fontenot, Lt. Col. E.J. Degen, and Lt. Col. David Tohn: ‘On Point: The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom’, Chapter 6 ‘Regime Collapse’ } The fall of Baghdad saw the outbreak of regional, sectarian violence throughout the country, as Iraqi tribes and cities began to fight each other over old grudges. The Iraqi cities of Al-Kut and Nasiriyah launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of the new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued. thumb U.S. General Tommy Franks assumed control of Iraq as the supreme commander of the coalition occupation forces. Shortly after the sudden collapse of the defense of Baghdad, rumors were circulating in Iraq and elsewhere that there had been a deal struck (a &quot; safqua &quot; ) wherein the U.S.-led Coalition had bribed key members of the Iraqi military elite and/or the Ba&apos;ath party itself to stand down. In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led Coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear. U.S.-led Coalition troops promptly began searching for the key members of Saddam Hussein&apos;s government. These individuals were identified by a variety of means, most famously through sets of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. Later during the military occupation period after the invasion, on 22 July 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from Task Force 20, Saddam Hussein&apos;s sons Uday and Qusay, and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight. Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003 by the U.S. Army&apos;s 4th Infantry Division and members of Task Force 121 during Operation Red Dawn. [ Other areas ] { Diwaniyah } In the north, Kurdish forces opposed to Saddam Hussein had already occupied for years an autonomous area in northern Iraq. With the assistance of U.S. Special Forces and air strikes, they were able to rout the Iraqi units near them and to occupy oil-rich Kirkuk on 10 April. U.S. special forces had also been involved in the extreme south of Iraq, attempting to occupy key roads to Syria and airbases. In one case two armored platoons were used to convince Iraqi leadership that an entire armored battalion was entrenched in the west of Iraq. On 15 April, U.S. forces took control of Tikrit, the last major outpost in central Iraq, with an attack led by the Marines&apos; Task Force Tripoli. About a week later the Marines were relieved in place by the Army&apos;s 4th Infantry Division.

The invasion did require a large army build-up like the 1991 Gulf War, but many did not see combat and many were withdrawn after the invasion ended. This proved to be short-sighted, however, due to the requirement for a much larger force to combat the irregular Iraqi forces in the aftermath of the war. General Eric Shinseki, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, recommended &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; { Dave Moniz, USA TODAY, 2 June 2003 } troops be used to maintain post-war order, but then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld —and especially his deputy, civilian Paul Wolfowitz —strongly disagreed. General Abizaid later said General Shinseki had been right.

Attacks on U.S. supply routes by Fedayeen militiamen were repulsed. The Iraqis&apos; artillery proved largely ineffective, and they were unable to mobilize their air force to attempt a defense. The Iraqi T-72 tanks, the most powerful armored vehicles in the Iraqi army, were both outdated and ill-maintained, and when they were mobilized they were rapidly destroyed, thanks in part to the Coalition air supremacy. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Naval Aviation, and British Royal Air Force operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended resistance targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived. The main battle tank s of the U.S. and UK forces, the U.S. M1 Abrams and British Challenger 2, proved worthy in the rapid advance across the country. With the large number of RPG attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few U.S. and UK tanks were lost and no tank crew were killed by hostile fire. The only tank loss sustained by the British Army was a Challenger 2 of the Queen&apos;s Royal Lancers that was hit by another Challenger 2, killing two crew members. The Iraqi army suffered from poor morale, even amongst the elite Republican Guard. Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon the approach of invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces to surrender. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. Worse, the Iraqi army had incompetent leadership – reports state that Qusay Hussein, charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units within were both confused and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target-points rather than seek engagements with Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war fully intact and without ever having been engaged by U.S. forces, especially in southern Iraq.

The FBI was soon called into Iraq to track down the stolen items. It was found that the initial allegations of looting of substantial portions of the collection were heavily exaggerated. Initial reports asserted a near-total looting of the museum, estimated at upwards of 170,000 inventory lots, or about 501,000 pieces. The more recent estimate places the number of stolen pieces at around 15,000, and about 10,000 of them probably were taken in an &quot; inside job &quot; before U.S. troops arrived, according to Bogdanos.

Concerning Iraq’s weapons programs, prominent critics included Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector who argued in 2002 that inspections had eliminated the nuclear and chemical weapons programs, and that evidence of their reconstitution would “have been eminently detectable by intelligence services ….” Although it is popularly believed that Saddam Hussein had forced the IAEA weapons inspectors to leave Iraq, they were in fact withdrawn at the request of US Ambassador Peter Burleigh in advance of Operation Desert Fox, the 1998 American bombing campaign. After the build-up of U.S. troops in neighboring states, Hussein welcomed them back and promised complete cooperation with their demands.

Robin Cook, then the leader of the United Kingdom House of Commons and a former foreign secretary, resigned from Tony Blair&apos;s cabinet in protest over the UK’s decision to invade without the authorization of a U.N. resolution.

United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in an interview with the BBC in September 2004, &quot; [F]rom our point of view and from the Charter point of view [the war] was illegal. &quot; [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661640.stm Excerpts: Annan interview 16 September 2004 BBC News 7 August 2007 ] This drew immediate criticism from the United States and was immediately played down. &quot; [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25685-2004Sep16.html U.S., Allies Dispute Annan on Iraq War Colum Lynch Washington Post 17 September 2004 A18 25 May 2006 ] His annual report to the General Assembly for 2003 included no more than the statement: &quot; Following the end of major hostilities which resulted in the occupation of Iraq... &quot; [ A-58-1 Document General Assembly 58 9 8 August 2007 28 August 2003 ] A similar report from the Security Council was similarly terse in its reference to the event: &quot; Following the cessation of hostilities in Iraq in April 2003... &quot; [ A-58-2 Document General Assembly 58 20 8 August 2007 23 September 2003 ] However, some argue that Kofi Annan was simply picking sides and playing politics. The United Nations Security Council has passed nearly 60 resolutions on Iraq and Kuwait since Iraq&apos;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The most relevant to this issue is Resolution 678, passed on 29 November 1990. It authorizes &quot; member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait... to use all necessary means &quot; to (1) implement Security Council Resolution 660 and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraq&apos;s occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) &quot; restore international peace and security in the area. &quot; However, the phrase &quot; restore international peace and security in the area &quot; was widely understood to refer to Iraq&apos;s invasion of Kuwait and was not a blank check for future military aggression against Iraq. [ Military intervention vs diplomatic solution ] { Dominique de Villepin&apos;s speech at the U.N. Security Council (14 February 2003) } Criticisms about the evidence used to justify the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort. This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, who responded to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell&apos;s 5 February 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: &quot; Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq&apos;s part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement of the means of inspections. &quot; { “Nations take sides after Powell&apos;s speech”. CNN.com, 6 February 2003.

Anti-French propangada exploiting the classic Francophobic clichés immediately ensued in the United States and the United Kingdom. A call for a boycott on French wine was launched in the United States and the New York Post covered on the 1944 &quot; Sacrifice &quot; of the GIs France would had forgotten. It was followed a week later, on 20 February, by the British newspaper The Sun publishing a special issue entitled &quot; Chirac is a worm &quot; and including ad hominem attacks such as &quot; Jacques Chirac has become the shame of Europe &quot;. { 20 heures le journal : émission du 20 février 2003 (National Audiovisual Institute archives), French news national edition, France 2 French public channel, 20 February 2003 } Actually both newspapers expressed the opinion of their owner, U.S. billionaire Rupert Murdoch, a military intervention supporter and a George W. Bush partisan as argued by Roy Greenslade in The Guardian published on 17 February.

Bush often describes the Iraq War as a “central front in the war on terror ”. { Office of the Press Secretary. President Addresses Nation, Discusses Iraq, War on Terror &quot;. White House Press Release, 28 June 2005. Retrieved on 17 April 2007. } Some critics of the war, particularly within the U.S. military community, argued pointedly against the conflation of Iraq and the war on terror, and criticized Bush for losing focus on the more important objective of fighting al-Qaeda. As Marine Lieut. General Greg Newbold, the Pentagon&apos;s former top operations officer, wrote in a 2006 TIME article, “I now regret that I did not more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were peripheral to the real threat—al-Qaeda.” { Newbold, Greg. &quot; Why Iraq Was a Mistake &quot;. Time Magazine, 9 April 2006. Retrieved on 16 April 2007. } Critics within this vein have further argued that containment would have been an effective strategy for the Hussein government, and that the top U.S. priorities in the Middle East should be encouraging a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, working for the moderation of Iran, and solidifying gains made in Afghanistan and Central Asia. In an October 2002 speech, Retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, former head of Central Command for U.S. forces in the Middle East and State Department&apos;s envoy to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, called Iraq “maybe six or seven,” in terms of U.S. Middle East priorities, adding that “the affordability line may be drawn around five.” { Boehlert, Eric. &quot; I&apos;m not sure which planet they live on &quot;. Salon, 17 October 20002. Retrieved 17 April 2007. } However, while commander of CENTCOM, Zinni held a very different opinion concerning the threat posed by Iraq. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2000, Zinni said: “Iraq remains the most significant near-term threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region. This is primarily due to its large conventional military force, pursuit of WMD, oppressive treatment of Iraqi citizens, refusal to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR), persistent threats to enforcement of the No Fly Zones (NFZ), and continued efforts to violate UN Security Council sanctions through oil smuggling.” [ http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/2000/000229az.pdf Statement of General Anthony C.

[ Potential to destabilize the region ] Besides arguing that Iraq was not the top strategic priority in the war on terrorism or in the Middle East, critics of the war also suggested that it could potentially destabilize the surrounding region. Prominent among such critics was Brent Scowcroft, who served as National Security Advisor to George H. W. Bush. In an 15 August 2002 Wall Street Journal editorial entitled &quot; Don&apos;t attack Saddam, &quot; Scowcroft wrote that, “Possibly the most dire consequences would be the effect in the region... there would be an explosion of outrage against us... the results could well destabilize Arab regimes”, and, “could even swell the ranks of the terrorists.” { Scowcroft, Brent. &quot; Don&apos;t attack Saddam &quot;.

However this was quickly changed to &quot; Operation Iraqi Freedom. &quot; Also notable was the usage &quot; death squad s &quot; to refer to Fedayeen paramilitary forces. Members of the Saddam Hussein government were called by disparaging nicknames – e.g., &quot; Chemical Ali &quot; ( Ali Hassan al-Majid ), &quot; Baghdad Bob &quot; or &quot; Comical Ali &quot; ( Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf ), and &quot; Mrs. Anthrax &quot; or &quot; Chemical Sally &quot; ( Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash ).

What is now France made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as Gaul. Roman writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the Gauls, the Aquitani, and the Belgae. The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were a Celtic people speaking what is known as the Gaulish language. Over the course of the first millennium BC the Greeks, Romans, and Carthaginians established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and the offshore islands. The Roman Republic annexed southern Gaul as the province of Gallia Narbonensis in the late 2nd century BC, and Roman forces under Julius Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul in the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC. Afterwards a Gallo-Roman culture emerged and Gaul was increasingly integrated into the Roman Empire. In the later stages of the Roman Empire, Gaul was subject to barbarian raids and migration, most importantly by the Germanic Franks. The Frankish king Clovis I united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century, setting the stage for Frankish dominance in the region for hundreds of years. Frankish power reached its fullest extent under Charlemagne. The medieval Kingdom of France emerged out of the western part of Charlemagne&apos;s Carolingian Empire, known as West Francia, and achieved increasing prominence under the rule of the House of Capet, founded by Hugh Capet in 987. A succession crisis following the death of the last Capetian monarch in 1337 led to the series of conflicts known as the Hundred Years War between the House of Valois and the House of Plantagenet. The wars ended with a Valois victory in 1453, solidifying the power of the Ancien Régime as a highly centralized absolute monarchy. During the next centuries, France experienced the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation, as well as recurring religious conflicts and wars with other powers. A burgeoning worldwide colonial empire was established from the 16th century. In the late 18th century the monarchy and associated institutions were overthrown in the French Revolution, which forever changed French and world history. The country was governed for a period as a Republic, until the French Empire was declared by Napoleon Bonaparte. Following Napoleon&apos;s defeat in the Napoleonic Wars France went through several further regime changes, being ruled as a monarchy, then briefly as a Second Republic, and then as a Second Empire, until a more lasting Third French Republic was established in 1870. France was one of the Triple Entente powers in World War I, fighting alongside the United Kingdom, Russia, and their allies against the Central Powers. It was one of the Allied Powers in World War II, but was conquered by Nazi Germany within two months. The Third Republic was dismantled, and most of the country was controlled directly by the Axis Powers, while the south was controlled by the collaborationist Vichy government. Following liberation, a Fourth Republic was established; this was succeeded in 1958 by the French Fifth Republic, the country&apos;s current government. After the war decolonization saw most of the French colonial empire become independent, while other parts were incorporated into the French state as overseas department s and collectivities. Since World War II France has been a leading member in the UN, the European Union and NATO, and remains a strong economic, cultural, military and political influence in the 21st century. [ Prehistory ] Cave painting in Lascaux. &lt; /s &gt; [ Prehistory of France ] The Neanderthal s, a member of the homo genus, were present in Europe from about 200,000 BC, but died out about 30,000 years ago, possibly out-competed by the modern humans during a period of cold weather. The earliest modern humans – Homo sapiens – entered Europe (including France) around 50,000 years ago (the Upper Palaeolithic ). The cave paintings of Lascaux and Gargas (Gargas in the Hautes-Pyrénées ) as well as the Carnac stones are remains of the local prehistoric activity. [ Ancient history ] [ Greek colonies ] [ Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies ] In 600 BC, Ionia n Greeks, originating from Phocaea, founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille ), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, making it the oldest city of France. [ I. E. S. Edwards, ed. The Cambridge Ancient History http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dn1TmVvMwmo4C%26amp%3Bpg%3DRA1-PA754 1970 Cambridge U.P. 754 ] [ Claude Orrieux Pauline Schmitt Pantel A History of Ancient Greece http://books.google.com/books?id%3Db8cA8hymTw8C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA62 1999 Blackwell 62 ] At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated some parts of the current territory of France, but this occupation spread in the rest of France only between the 5th and 3rd century BC. { Carpentier et al 2000, p.29 } [ Gaul ] [ Gaul ] { Massalia (modern } { Marseille ) silver coin with Greek legend, a testimony to } { Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul, 5th–1st century BCE. } Covering large parts of modern day France, Belgium, northwest Germany and northern Italy, Gaul was inhabited by many Celtic and Belgae tribes whom the Romans referred to as Gauls and who spoke the Gaulish language roughly between the Seine and the Garonne (Gallia Celtica). On the lower Garonne the people spoke Aquitanian, an archaic language related to Basque whereas a Belgian language was spoken north of Lutecia. The Celts founded cities such as Lutetia Parisiorum (Paris) and Burdigala (Bordeaux) while the Aquitanians founded Tolosa (Toulouse). Long before any Roman settlements, Greek navigators settled in what would become Provence. The Phoceans founded important cities such as Massalia (Marseille) and Nikaia (Nice), bringing them in to conflict with the neighboring Celts and Ligurians. Some Phocean great navigators, such as Pytheas, were born in Marseille. The Celts themselves often fought with Aquitanians and Germans, and a Gaulish war band led by Brennus invaded Rome c. 393 or 388 BC following the Battle of the Allia. However, the tribal society of the Gauls did not change fast enough for the centralized Roman state, who would learn to counter them. The Gaulish tribal confederacies were then defeated by the Romans in battles such as Sentinum and Telamon. In the early 3rd century BC, the Belgae conquered the surrounding territories of the Somme in northern Gaul after a battle supposedly against the Armoricani near Ribemont-sur-Ancre and Gournay-sur-Aronde, where sanctuaries were found. When Carthaginian commander Hannibal Barca fought the Romans, he recruited several Gaulish mercenaries who fought on his side at Cannae. It was this Gaulish participation that caused Provence to be annexed in 122 BC by the Roman Republic. [ December 2008 ] Later, the Consul of Gaul— Julius Caesar —conquered all of Gaul. Despite Gaulish opposition led by Vercingetorix, the Overking of the Warriors, the Gauls succumbed to the Roman onslaught. The Gauls had some success at first at Gergovia, but were ultimately defeated at Alesia. The Romans founded cities such as Lugdunum (Lyon) and Narbonensis (Narbonne). [ Roman Gaul ] [ Roman Gaul ] { Vercingetorix surrenders to } { Julius Caesar after } { Alesia. Painting by Lionel-Noël Royer, 1899. } Gaul was divided into several different provinces. The Romans displaced populations to prevent local identities from becoming a threat to Roman control. Thus, many Celts were displaced in Aquitania or were enslaved and moved out of Gaul. There was a strong cultural evolution in Gaul under the Roman Empire, the most obvious one being the replacement of the Gaulish language by Vulgar Latin. It has been argued the similarities between the Gaulish and Latin languages favoured the transition. Gaul remained under Roman control for centuries and Celtic culture was then gradually replaced by Gallo-Roman culture. The Gauls became better integrated with the Empire with the passage of time. For instance, Marcus Antonius Primus, an important general of the Roman Empire, and Emperor Claudius were both born in Gaul, as were general Gnaeus Julius Agricola and emperor Caracalla. Antoninus Pius also came from a Gaulish family. In the decade following Valerian &apos;s capture by the Persians in 260, Postumus established a short-lived Gallic Empire, which included the Iberian Peninsula and Britannia, in addition to Gaul itself. Germanic tribes, the Franks and the Alamanni, entered Gaul at this time. The Gallic Empire ended with Emperor Aurelian &apos;s victory at Châlons in 274. Gaulish soldiers. A migration of Celts appeared in the 4th century in Armorica. They were led by the legendary king Conan Meriadoc and came from Britain. They spoke the now extinct British language, which evolved into the Breton, Cornish, and Welsh language s. In 418 the Aquitanian province was given to the Goths in exchange for their support against the Vandals. Those same Goths had previously sacked Rome in 410 and established a capital in Toulouse. The Roman Empire had difficulty responding to all the barbarian raids, and Flavius Aëtius had to use these tribes against each other in order to maintain some Roman control. He first used the Huns against the Burgundians, and these mercenaries destroyed Worms, killed king Gunther, and pushed the Burgundians westward. The Burgundians were resettled by Aëtius near Lugdunum in 443. The Huns, united by Attila became a greater threat, and Aëtius used the Visigoths against the Huns. The conflict climaxed in 451 at the Battle of Châlons, in which the Romans and Goths defeated Attila. The Roman Empire was on the verge of collapsing. Aquitania was definitely abandoned to the Visigoths, who would soon conquer a significant part of southern Gaul as well as most of the Iberian Peninsula. The Burgundians claimed their own kingdom, and northern Gaul was practically abandoned to the Franks. Aside from the Germanic peoples, the Vascones entered Wasconia from the Pyrenees and the Bretons formed three kingdoms in Armorica: Domnonia, Cornouaille and Broërec. { P. J. Heather, The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History of Rome and the Barbarians (2007) } [ Frankish kingdoms (486–987) ] [ Frankish Empire ] [ List of Frankish Kings Merovingian Carolingian Renaissance Early Middle Ages ] { Battle of Tours. This battle is often considered of macro-importance in European and Islamic history. } In 486, Clovis I, leader of the Salian Franks, defeated Syagrius at Soissons and subsequently united most of northern and central Gaul under his rule. Clovis then recorded a succession of victories against other Germanic tribes such as the Alamanni at Tolbiac. In 496, pagan Clovis adopted Catholicism. This gave him greater legitimacy and power over his Christian subjects and granted him clerical support against the Arian Visigoths. He defeated Alaric II at Vouillé in 507 and annexed Aquitaine, and thus Toulouse, into his Frankish kingdom. The Goths retired to Toledo in what would become Spain. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian Dynasty but his kingdom would not survive his death. Under Frankish inheritance traditions, all sons would inherit part of the land, so four kingdoms emerged: centered on Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. Over time, the borders and numbers of Frankish kingdoms were fluid and changed frequently. Also during this time, the Mayors of the Palace, originally the chief advisor to the kings, would become the real power in the Frankish lands; the Merovingian kings themselves would be reduced to little more than figureheads. { Edward James, The Franks (1991) } By this time Muslim invaders had conquered Hispania and were threatening the Frankish kingdoms. Duke Odo the Great defeated a major invading force at Toulouse in 721 but failed to repel a raiding party in 732. The mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated that raiding party at the Battle of Tours (actually the battle took place between Tours and Poitiers) and earned respect and power within the Frankish Kingdom. The assumption of the crown in 751 by Pepin the Short (son of Charles Martel) established the Carolingian dynasty as the Kings of the Franks. { Charlemagne } Carolingian power reached its fullest extent under Pepin&apos;s son, Charlemagne. In 771, Charlemagne reunited the Frankish domains after a further period of division, subsequently conquering the Lombards under Desiderius in what is now northern Italy (774), incorporating Bavaria (788) into his realm, defeating the Avars of the Danubian plain (796), advancing the frontier with Islamic Spain as far south as Barcelona (801), and subjugating Lower Saxony (804) after a prolonged campaign. In recognition of his successes and his political support for the Papacy, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans, or Roman Emperor in the West, by Pope Leo III in 800. Charlemagne&apos;s son Louis the Pious (emperor 814–840) kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive Louis I&apos;s death. Two of his sons – Charles the Bald and Louis the German – swore allegiance to each other against their brother – Lothair I – in the Oaths of Strasbourg, and the empire was divided among Louis&apos;s three sons ( Treaty of Verdun, 843). After a last brief reunification (884–887), the imperial title ceased to be held in the western realm, which was to form the basis of the future French kingdom. The eastern realm, which would become Germany, elected the Saxon dynasty of Henry the Fowler. { Derek Wilson, Charlemagne (2007) } Under the Carolingian s, the kingdom was ravaged by Viking raiders. In this struggle some important figures such as Count Odo of Paris and his brother King Robert rose to fame and became kings. This emerging dynasty, whose members were called the Robertines, were the predecessors of the Capetian Dynasty. Led by Rollo, some Vikings had settled in Normandy and were granted the land, first as counts and then as dukes, by King Charles the Simple, in order to protect the land from other raiders. The people that emerged from the interactions between the new Viking aristocracy and the already mixed Franks and Gallo-Romans became known as the Normans. [ Elisabeth M. C. Van Houts The Normans in Europe http://books.google.com/books?id%3DIarkHmOdjnsC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA23 2000 Manchester U.P. 23 ] [ State building into the Kingdom of France (987–1453) ] [ France in the Middle Ages ] France was a very decentralised state during the Middle Ages. The authority of the king was more religious than administrative. The 11th century in France marked the apogee of princely power at the expense of the king when states like Normandy, Flanders or Languedoc enjoyed a local authority comparable to kingdoms in all but name. The Capetians, as they were descended from the Robertines, were formerly powerful princes themselves who had successfully unseated the weak and unfortunate Carolingian kings. The Carolingian Kings had nothing more than a royal title when the Capetian Kings added their principality to that title. The Capetians, in a way, held a dual status of King and Prince; as king they held the Crown of Charlemagne and as Count of Paris they held their personal fiefdom, best known as Île-de-France. The fact that the Capetians both held lands as Prince as well as in the title of King gave them a complicated status. Thus they were involved in the struggle for power within France as princes but they also had a religious authority over the Church of France as King. However, and despite the fact that the Capetian kings often treated other princes more as enemies and allies than as subordinates, their royal title was often recognised yet not often respected. The royal authority was so weak in some remote places that bandits were the effective power. { Georges Duby, France in the Middle Ages 987–1460: From Hugh Capet to Joan of Arc (1993), } Some of the king&apos;s vassals would grow so powerful that they would become some of the strongest rulers of western Europe. The Normans, the Plantagenets, the Lusignans, the Hautevilles, the Ramnulfids, and the House of Toulouse successfully carved lands outside of France for themselves. The most important of these conquests for French history was the Norman Conquest of England, following the Battle of Hastings, by William the Conqueror because it linked England to France through Normandy. Although the Normans were now both vassals of the French kings and their equals as Kings of England, their zone of political activity remained centered in France. { David Carpenter The Struggle for Mastery. The Penguin history of Britain 1066–1284 p. 91: &quot; In the first place, after 1072 William was largely an absentee. Of the 170 months remaining of his reign he spent around 130 in France, returning to England only on four occasions. This was no passing phase. Absentee kings continued to spend at best half their time in England until the loss of Normandy in 1204... But this absenteeism solidified rather than sapped royal government since it engendered structures both to maintain peace and extract money on the king&apos;s absence, money which was above all needed across the channel &quot;. } These Norman nobles then commissioned the weaving of the Bayeux Tapestry. An important part of the French aristocracy also involved itself in the crusades, and French knights founded and ruled the Crusader states. An example of the legacy left in the Middle East by these nobles is the Krak des Chevaliers &apos; enlargement by the Counts of Tripoli and Toulouse. [ Rise of the monarchy ] The history of the monarchy is how it overcame the powerful barons over ensuing centuries, and established absolute sovereignty over France in the 16th century. The history of modern France starts with the election Hugh Capet (940-996), the Count of Paris in 987. Hugh&apos;s lands extended little beyond the Paris basin; His political unimportance weighed against the powerful barons who elected him. Many of the king&apos;s vassals (who included for a long time the kings of England) ruled over territories far greater than his own. A number of factors contributed to the rise of the French monarchy. The dynasty established by Hugh Capet continued uninterrupted until 1328. The laws of primogeniture ensured orderly successions of power. Secondly, the successors of Capet came to be recognised as members of an illustrious and ancient royal house and therefore socially superior to their politically and economically superior rivals. Thirdly, the Capetians had the support of the Church which favoured a strong central government in France. This alliance with the Church was one of the great enduring legacies of the Capetians. The First Crusade was composed almost entirely of Frankish Princes. As time went on the power of the King was expanded by conquests, seizures and successful feudal political battles. [ Marvin Perry et al.

Capet was previously &quot; Duke of the Franks &quot; and then became &quot; King of the Franks &quot; (Rex Francorum). He was recorded to be recognised king by the Gauls, Bretons, Danes, Aquitanians, Goths, Spanish and Gascons. Hugh Capet&apos;s reign was marked by the loss of the Spanish marches as they grew more and more independent. Count Borell of Barcelona called for Hugh&apos;s help against Islamic raids, but even if Hugh intended to help Borell, he was otherwise occupied in fighting Charles of Lorraine. The loss of other Spanish principalities then followed. Hugh Capet, the first Capetian king, is not a well documented figure, his greatest achievement being certainly to survive as king and defeating the Carolingian claimant, thus allowing him to establish what would become one of Europe&apos;s most powerful house of kings. { William W. Kibler, ed. Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (1995) } Hugh&apos;s son – Robert the Pious – was crowned King of the Franks before Capet&apos;s demise. Hugh Capet decided so in order to have his succession secured. Robert II, as King of the Franks, met Emperor Henry II in 1023 on the borderline. They agreed to end all claims over each other&apos;s realm, setting a new stage of Capetian and Ottonian relationships. The reign of Robert II was quite important because it involved the Peace and Truce of God and the Cluniac Reforms. Although a king weak in power, Robert II&apos;s efforts were considerable. His surviving charters imply he was heavily relying on the church to rule France, much like his father did. Although he lived with a mistress — Bertha of Burgundy — and was excommunicated because of this, he was regarded as a model of piety for monks (hence his nickname, Robert the Pious). He crowned his son — Hugh Magnus — King of the Franks to secure his succession, however Hugh Magnus rebelled against his father and died fighting him. The next King of the Franks — Henry I — was crowned after Robert&apos;s death, which is quite exceptional for a French king of the times.Henry I was one of the weakest kings of the Franks, and his reign saw the rise of some very powerful nobles such as William the Conqueror. However his biggest source of concerns was his brother — Robert I of Burgundy — who was pushed by his mother to the conflict. Robert of Burgundy was made Duke of Burgundy by King Henry I and had to be satisfied with that title. From Henry I onward the Dukes of Burgundy were relatives of the King of the Franks until the end of the Duchy proper. King Philip I, named by his Kievan mother with a typically Eastern European name, was no more fortunate than his predecessor. { Kibler, ed. Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (1995) } { Godefroy de Bouillon, a French knight, leader of the } { First Crusade and founder of the } { Kingdom of Jerusalem. } It is from Louis VI onward that royal authority became more accepted. Louis VI was more a soldier and warmongering king than a scholar. The way the king raised money from his vassals made him quite unpopular; he was described as greedy and ambitious and that is corroborated by records of the time. His regular attacks on his vassals, although damaging the royal image, reinforced the royal power. From 1127 onward was a skilled politician – Abbot Suger. The abbot was the son of a minor family of knights, but his political advice was extremely valuable to the king. Louis VI successfully defeated, both military and politically, many of the robber baron s. Louis VI frequently summoned his vassals to the court, and those who did not show up often had their land possessions confiscated and military campaigns mounted against them. This drastic policy clearly imposed some royal authority on Paris and its surrounding areas. When Louis VI died in 1137, much progress had been made towards strengthening Capetian authority. Thanks to Abbot Suger&apos;s political advice, King Louis VII enjoyed greater moral authority over France than his predecessors. Even more powerful vassals such as Henry Plantagenet paid homage to the French king. { Capetian France 937–1328 p. 64: Then, in 1151, Henry Plantagenet paid homage for the duchy to Louis VII in Paris, homage he repeated as king of England in 1156. } Abbot Suger arranged the marriage between Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine in Bordeaux which made Louis VII Duke of Aquitaine and gave him considerable power. However, the couple disagreed over the burning of more than a thousand people in Vitry during the conflict against the Count of Champagne. King Louis VII was deeply horrified by the event and sought penitence by going to the holy land. He later involved the Kingdom of France in the Second Crusade but his relationship with Eleanor did not improve. The marriage was ultimately annulled by the pope under the pretext of consanguinity and Eleanor soon married the Duke of Normandy — Henry Fitzempress — who would become King of England as Henry II two years later. Louis VII was once a very powerful monarch and was now facing a much stronger vassal, who was his equal as King of England and his strongest prince as Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine. Abbot Suger&apos;s vision of construction became known as the Gothic Architecture during the later Renaissance. This style became standard for most European cathedrals built in the late middle-age. { Paul Frankl, Gothic Architecture (2001) } [ The late Capetians (1165–1328) ] The late direct Capetian kings were considerably more powerful and influential than the earliest ones. While Philip I could hardly control his Parisian barons, Philip IV could dictate popes and emperors. The late Capetians, although they often ruled for a shorter time than their earlier peers, were often much more influential. This period also saw the rise of a complex system of international alliances and conflicts opposing, through dynasties, Kings of France and England and Holy Roman Emperor. [ Philip II Augustus ] The reign of Philip II Augustus marked an important step in the history of French monarchy. His reign saw the French royal domain and influence greatly expanded. He had set the context for the rise of power to much more powerful monarchs like Saint Louis and Philip the Fair. { Philip II victorious at } { Bouvines thus annexing Normandy and Anjou into his royal domains. This battle involved a complex set of alliances from three important states, the Kingdoms of France and England and the Holy Roman Empire. } Philip II spent an important part of his reign fighting the so-called Angevin Empire, which was probably the greatest threat to the King of France since the rise of the Capetian dynasty. During the first part of his reign Philip II tried using Henry II of England&apos;s son against him. He allied himself with the Duke of Aquitaine and son of Henry II — Richard Lionheart — and together they launched a decisive attack on Henry&apos;s castle and home of Chinon and removed him from power. Richard replaced his father as King of England afterward. The two kings then went crusading during the Third Crusade however their alliance and friendship broke down during the crusade. The two men were once again at odds and fought each other in France and Richard was on the verge of totally defeating Philip II. Adding to their battles in France the Kings of France and England were trying to install their respective allies at the head of the Holy Roman Empire. If Philip II Augustus supported Philip of Swabia, member of the House of Hohenstaufen, Richard Lionheart supported Otto IV, member of the House of Welf. Otto IV had the upper hand and became the Holy Roman Emperor at the expense of Philip of Swabia. The crown of France was saved by Richard&apos;s demise after a wound he received fighting his own vassals in Limousin. John Lackland, Richard&apos;s successor, refused to come to the French court for a trial against the Lusignan s and as Louis VI often did to his rebellious vassals, Philip II confiscated John&apos;s possessions in France. John&apos;s defeat was swift and his attempts to reconquer his French possession at the Battle of Bouvines resulted in complete failure. His allies, most notably Emperor Otto IV, were all defeated or captured and even as King of England he had no means to reconquer Normandy and Anjou. Not only had Philip II annexed Normandy and Anjou, he had captured the Counts of Boulogne and Flanders. Otto IV was overthrown by Frederick II, ally of Philip II of France and a member of the House of Hohenstaufen. The King of France however stopped before conquering Aquitaine and Gascony who remained loyal to the Plantagenet King. In addition to defeating John of England, Philip Augustus founded the Sorbonne and made Paris a city for scholars. Prince Louis (the future Louis VIII) was involved in the subsequent English civil war as French and English (or rather Anglo-Norman) aristocracies were once one and were now split between allegiances. While the French kings were struggling against the Plantagenets, the Church called for the Albigensian Crusade. Southern France was then largely absorbed in the royal domains. [ Saint Louis ] { Saint Louis. He saw France&apos;s cultural expansion in the Western Christian world. } France became a truly centralised kingdom under Louis IX, who initiated several administrative reforms. Saint Louis has often been portrayed as a one dimensional character, a flawless representant of the faith and an administrator caring for the governed ones. However, his reign was far from perfect for everyone; he made unsuccessful crusades and his expanding administrations raised oppositions; he also burned Jewish books at the Pope&apos;s urging. [ Gigot Francis E. Judaism 1910 The Catholic Encyclopedia VIII New York Robert Appleton Company http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm 13 August 2007 ] His judgments were not often practical, although they seemed fair by the standards of the time. It appears Louis had a strong sense of justice and always wanted to judge people himself before applying any sentence. This was said about Louis and French clergy asking for excommunications of Louis&apos; vassals: { Capetian France p. 265. } [ For it would be against God and contrary to right and justice if he compelled any man to seek absolution when the clergy were doing him wrong. ] Louis IX was only twelve years old when he became King of France, his mother — Blanche of Castile — was the effective power although the King was indeed Louis IX. Blanche&apos;s authority was strongly opposed by the French barons yet she could maintain her position as regent (although she did not formally use the title) until Louis was old enough to rule by himself. In 1229 the King had to struggle with a long lasting strike at the University of Paris, the Quartier Latin was strongly hit by these strikes. War was still going on in the County of Toulouse, the royal army was occupied fighting resistance in Languedoc and the kingdom was therefore vulnerable. Count Raymond VII of Toulouse finally signed the Treaty of Paris in 1229, in which he retained much of his lands to life, but his daughter, married to Count Alfonso of Poitou, produced him no heir and so the County of Toulouse went to the King of France. King Henry III of England had not yet recognized the Capetian overlordship over Aquitaine and still hoped to recover Normandy and Anjou and reform the Angevin Empire. He landed in 1230 at Saint-Malo with a massive force. Henry III&apos;s allies in Brittany and Normandy fell down because they did not dare fight their king who led the counterstrike himself. This evolved into the Saintonge War, Henry III was defeated and had to recognise Louis IX&apos;s overlordship although the King of France did not seize Aquitaine from Henry III. Louis IX was now the most important landowner of France, adding to his royal title. There were some opposition to his rule in Normandy, yet it proved remarkably easy to rule, especially compared to the County of Toulouse which had been brutally conquered. The Conseil du Roi, which would evolve into the Parlement, was founded in these times. Saint Louis also supported new forms of art such as Gothic architecture; his Sainte-Chapelle became a very famous gothic building, and he is also credited for the Morgan Bible. After his conflict with King Henry III of England Louis established a cordial relation with the Plantagenet King. An amusing anecdote is about Henry III&apos;s attending the French Parlement, as Duke of Aquitaine, the King of England was always late because he liked to stop each time he met a priest to hear the mass, so Louis made sure no priest was on the way of Henry III. Henry III and Louis IX then started a long contest in who was the most faithful up to the point none ever arrived anymore on time to the Parlement which was then allowed to debate in their absence. { Capetian France p. 264. } The Kingdom was involved in two crusades under Saint Louis: the Seventh Crusade and the Eighth Crusade. Both proved to be complete failures for the French King. He died in the Eighth Crusade and Philip III became king. Philip III took part in another crusading disaster: the Aragonese Crusade, which cost him his life. More administrative reforms were made by Philip the Fair. This king was responsible for the end of the Templars, signed the Auld Alliance, and established the Parlement of Paris. Philip IV was so powerful that he could name popes and emperors, unlike the early Capetians. The papacy was moved to Avignon and all the contemporary popes were French such as Philip IV&apos;s puppet: Bertrand de Goth.

This was also the time of the Black Death, as well as several civil wars. The French population suffered much from these wars. In 1420 by the Treaty of Troyes Henry V was made heir to Charles VI. Henry V failed to outlive Charles so it was Henry VI of England and France who consolidated the Dual-Monarchy of England and France. It has been argued that the difficult conditions the French population suffered during the Hundred Years&apos; War awakened French nationalism, a nationalism represented by Joan of Arc. Although this is debatable, the Hundred Years&apos; War is remembered more as a Franco-English war than as a succession of feudal struggles. During this war, France evolved politically and militarily. Although a Franco-Scottish army was successful at Baugé, the humiliating defeats of Poitiers and Agincourt forced the French nobility to realise they could not stand just as armoured knights without an organised army. Charles VII established the first French standing army, the Compagnies d&apos;ordonnance, and defeated the Plantagenets once at Patay and again, using cannons, at Formigny. The Battle of Castillon was regarded as the last engagement of this &quot; war &quot;, yet Calais and the Channel Islands remained ruled by the Plantagenets.

[ Early Modern France (1453–1789) ] [ Early Modern France ] { Charles the Bold, the last Valois } { Duke of Burgundy, died at the } { Battle of Nancy. His death marked the division of his lands between the Kings of France and Habsburg Dynasty. } The Duke of Burgundy had assembled a large territory including his native duchy and the Burgundian Netherlands. King Louis XI faced Charles the Bold during Burgundian Wars and the French King was allied with the Old Swiss Confederacy. The Duke of Burgundy was defeated at Morat, Battle of Grandson, Héricourt and ultimately defeated at Nancy in 1477. The Duchy of Burgundy was annexed by France but the part of Burgundy that formed Franche-Comté was given to Philip I of Castile in 1493. From 1487 to 1491, France attacked and defeated Brittany, an independent duchy.In 1532, Brittany was incorporated into the Kingdom of France. [ Estates ] Political power was widely dispersed. The Catholic Church controlled about 40% of the wealth, tied up in long-term endowments that could be added to but not reduced. The king (not the pope) nominated bishops, but typically had to negotiate with noble families that had close ties to local monasteries and church establishments. The nobility came second in terms of wealth, but there was no unity as each noble had his own lands, his network of regional connections, and his own military force. The cities had a quasi-independent status, and were largely controlled by the leading merchants and guilds. Paris was by far the largest city with 220,000 people in 1547 and a history of steady growth. Lyons and Rouen each had about 40,000 population, but Lyon had a powerful banking community and a vibrant culture. Bordeaux was next with only 20,000 population in 1500. About 97% of France&apos;s 13 million people (in 1484) lived in rural villages. In many cases the peasants had well-established rights that the authorities had to respect. In terms of political power the law courts ( &quot; Parlements &quot; ) were powerful, especially that of France. The king had bout 10,000 officials in royal service—very few indeed for such a large country, and with very slow internal communications over an inadequate road system. (Travel was usually faster by ocean ship or river boat.) The different estates occasionally met together in the &quot; Estates General &quot;, but in practice it had no power, for it could petition the king but could not pass laws. The sense of &quot; being French &quot; was uncommon in 1500, as people clung to their local identities. By 1600, however, people were starting to call themselves &quot; bon françois. &quot; { Frederick J. Baumgartner, France in the Sixteenth Century (1995) pp 4-7 } [ Rural society ] In the 17th century peasants had ties to the market economy, provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village (or town). Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The &quot; stable &quot; core of French society, town guildspeople and village labourers, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal. Accepting the existence of these two societies, the constant tension between them, and extensive geographic and social mobility tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the social structure, economy, and even political system of early modern France. Collins (1991) argues that the Annales School paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy; and grossly exaggerated social stability. { James B. Collins, &quot; Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-modern France. &quot; Journal of Social History 1991 24(3): 563-577. Issn: 0022-4529 Fulltext: } { Ebsco. For the Annales interpretation see Pierre Goubert, The French Peasantry in the Seventeenth Century (1986) excerpt and text search } [ Wars ] France engaged in the long Italian Wars (1494–1559), which marked the beginning of early modern France. Francis I faced powerful foes, and he was captured at Pavia. The French monarchy then sought for allies and found one in the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Admiral Barbarossa captured Nice on 5 August 1543 and handed it down to Francis I. Around this same time, the Protestant Reformation, led in France mainly by John Calvin, was challenging the power of the Catholic Church in France. During the 16th century, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs were the dominant power in Europe. In addition to Spain and Austria, they controlled a number of kingdoms and duchies across Europe. Charles Quint, under the titles of Count of Burgundy, Holy Roman Emperor, and King of Aragon, Castile and Germany, among others, encircled France. The Spanish Tercio was used with great success against French knights. Finally, on 7 January 1558, the Duke of Guise seized Calais from the English. [ Language ] [ History of French ] Although most peasants in France spoke local dialects, an official language emerged in Paris and the French language became the preferred language of Europe&apos;s aristocracy. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (born in 1500) quipped, &quot; I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse. &quot; [ http://books.google.com/books?id%3DtCobBRiv3_MC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA299 299 The letters of George Santayana: 1948–1952, Book 8 George Santayana, William G. Holzberger MIT Press, 2008 0-262-19571-2 31  July2008 ] Because of its international status, there was a desire to regulate the French language. Several reforms of the French language worked to make it more uniform. The Renaissance writer François Rabelais (b. 1494) helped to shape French as a literary language, Rabelais&apos; French is characterised by the re-introduction of Greek and Latin words. Jacques Peletier du Mans (born 1517) was one of the scholars who reformed the French language. He improved Nicolas Chuquet &apos;s long scale system by adding names for intermediate numbers ( &quot; milliards &quot; instead of &quot; thousand million &quot;, etc.). [ Colonies ] [ French colonial empire ] During the 16th century, the king established colonies and began to claim and settle North American territories. { Christopher Hodson and Brett Rushforth, &quot; Absolutely Atlantic: Colonialism and the Early Modern French State in Recent Historiography, &quot; History Compass, (Jan 2010) 8#1 pp 101-117, } Jacques Cartier was one of the great explorers who ventured deep into American territories during the 16th century. The largest settlement was New France, with the towns of Quebec City and Montreal with settlement commencing in the early 17th century with the voyages of Samuel de Champlain. { Allan Greer, &quot; National, Transnational, and Hypernational Historiographies: New France Meets Early American History, &quot; Canadian Historical Review, (2010) 91#4 pp 695-724, in Project MUSE } [ Huguenots ] [ French Wars of Religion ] { Henry IV of France, King of } { France and } { Navarre, was the first French } { Bourbon king. } Renewed Catholic reaction headed by the powerful duke of Guise, led to a massacre of Huguenots at Vassy in 1562, starting the first of the French Wars of Religion, during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and Catholic forces. In the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew&apos;s Day massacre of 1572. The Wars of Religion culminated in the War of the Three Henrys in which Henry III assassinated Henry de Guise, leader of the Spanish-backed Catholic league, and the king was murdered in return. Following this war Henry III of Navarre became king of France as Henry IV and enforced the Edict of Nantes (1598). { Mack P. Holt, The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629 (2nd ed. 2005 } French Protestantism, which was largely Calvinist derived its support from the lesser nobles and trading classes. Its two main strongholds were south west France and Normandy, but even in these districts the Catholics were a majority. Protestantism in France was considered a grave threat to national unity, as the Huguenot minority felt a closer affinity with German and Dutch Calvinists than with their fellow Frenchmen. In an effort to cement their position they often allied with French enemies. The animosity between the two sides led to the French Wars of Religion and the St. Bartholomew&apos;s Day Massacre. The religious wars ended in 1593, when the Huguenot Henry of Navarre (1553-1610), who was already effectively king of France became a Catholic and was recognised by both Catholics and Protestants as King Henry IV (reigned 1589-1610). The main provisions of the Edict of Nantes (1598), which Henry IV had issued as a charter of religious freedoms for the Huguenots, were as follows; a) Huguenots were allowed to hold religious services in certain towns in each province; b) They were allowed to control and fortify eight cities (including La Rochelle and Montauban ); c) Special courts were established to try Huguenot offenders; d)Huguenots were to have equal civil rights with the Catholics. The military privileges were incorporated in the Edict in order to allay the fears of the minority. Over time it became clear these privileges would be open to abuse and when in 1620 the Huguenots proclaimed a constitution for the &apos;Republic of the Reformed Churches of France&apos;, the Prime Minister Cardinal Richelieu (1585–1642) invoked the entire powers of the state. Religious conflicts therefore resumed under Louis XIII when Richelieu forced Protestants to disarm their army and fortresses. This conflict ended in the Siege of La Rochelle (1627–1628), in which Protestants and their English supporters were defeated. The following Peace of Alais confirmed religious freedom yet dismantled the Protestant defences. { Mack P. Holt, The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629 (2nd ed. 2005 } In the face of persecution, Huguenots dispersed widely throughout Protestant kingdoms in Europe and America. { Randy J. Sparks and Bertrand Van Ruymbeke, Memory and Identity: The Huguenots in France and the Atlantic Diaspora (2008) } [ Thirty Years war ] [ Thirty Years War ] The religious conflicts that plagued France also ravaged the Habsburg-led Holy Roman Empire. The Thirty Years War eroded the power of the Catholic Habsburgs. Although Cardinal Richelieu, the powerful chief minister of France, had previously mauled the Protestants, he joined this war on their side in 1636 because it was the raison d&apos;état. Imperial Habsburg forces invaded France, ravaged Champagne, and nearly threatened Paris. Richelieu died in 1642 and was succeeded by Cardinal Mazarin, while Louis XIII died one year later and was succeeded by Louis XIV. France was served by some very efficient commanders such as Louis II de Bourbon (Condé) and Henry de la Tour d&apos;Auvergne (Turenne). The French forces won a decisive victory at Rocroi (1643), and the Spanish army was decimated; the Tercio was broken. The Truce of Ulm (1647) and the Peace of Westphalia (1648) brought an end to the war. But some challenges remained. France was hit by civil unrest known as the Fronde which in turn evolved into the Franco-Spanish War in 1653. Louis II de Bourbon joined the Spanish army this time, but suffered a severe defeat at Dunkirk (1658) by Henry de la Tour d&apos;Auvergne. The terms for the peace inflicted upon the Spanish kingdoms in the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) were harsh, as France annexed Northern Catalonia. { Peter H. Wilson, Europe’s Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years War (2009) } Amidst this turmoil, René Descartes sought answers to philosophical questions through the use of logic and reason and formulated what would be called Cartesian Dualism in 1641. [ Louis XIV ] [ Louis XIV ] { Louis XIV, the &quot; Sun King &quot; } Louis XIV, known as the &quot; Sun King &quot;, wanted to be remembered as a patron of the arts, like his ancestor Louis IX. He invited Jean-Baptiste Lully to establish the French opera. A tumultuous friendship was established between Lully and Molière. Jules Hardouin Mansart became France&apos;s most important architect of the period. Louis XIV&apos;s long reign saw France involved in many wars that drained its treasury. His reign began during the Thirty Years&apos; War and during the Franco-Spanish war. His military architect, Vauban, became famous for his pentagonal fortresses, and Jean-Baptiste Colbert supported the royal spending as much as possible. French dominated League of the Rhine fought against the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Saint Gotthard in 1664. The battle was won by the Christians, chiefly through the brave attack of 6,000 French troops led by La Feuillade and Coligny. { Count Miklós Zrínyi,the Poet-Warlord } France fought the War of Devolution against Spain in 1667. France&apos;s defeat of Spain and invasion of the Spanish Netherlands alarmed England and Sweden. With the Dutch Republic they formed the Triple Alliance to check Louis XIV&apos;s expansion. Louis II de Bourbon had captured Franche-Comté, but in face of an indefensible position, Louis XIV agreed to a peace at Aachen. Under its terms, Louis XIV did not annex Franche-Comté but did gain Lille. { John B. Wolf, Louis XIV (1968), the standard scholarly biography online edition } Peace was fragile, and war broke out again between France and the Dutch Republic in the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678). Louis XIV asked for the Dutch Republic to resume war against the Spanish Netherlands, but the republic refused. France attacked the Dutch Republic and was joined by England in this conflict. Through targeted inundations of polder s by breaking dykes, the French invasion of the Dutch Republic was brought to a halt. The Dutch Admiral Michiel de Ruyter inflicted a few strategic defeats on the Anglo-French naval alliance and forced England to retire from the war in 1674. Because the Netherlands could not resist indefinitely, it agreed to peace in the Treaties of Nijmegen, according to which France would annex France-Comté and acquire further concessions in the Spanish Netherlands. On 6 May 1682, the royal court moved to the Palace of Versailles, which Louis XIV had greatly expanded. Peace did not last, and war between France and Spain again resumed. The War of the Reunions broke out (1683–1684), and again Spain, with its ally the Holy Roman Empire, was easily defeated. Meanwhile, in October 1685 Louis signed the Edict of Fontainebleau ordering the destruction of all Protestant churches and schools in France. Its immediate consequence was a large Protestant exodus from France. The two massive famine s struck France between 1693 and 1710, killing over two million people. [ Ó Gráda Cormac Chevet, Jean-Michel 2002 Famine And Market In Ancient RégimeFrance The Journal of Economic History 62 706–733 10.1017/S0022050702001055 17494233 3 ] France would soon be involved in another war, the War of the Grand Alliance. This time the theatre was not only in Europe but also in North America. Although the war was long and difficult (it was also called the Nine Years War), its results were inconclusive. The Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 confirmed French sovereignty over Alsace, yet rejected its claims to Luxembourg. Louis also had to evacuate Catalonia and the Palatinate. This peace was considered a truce by all sides, thus war was to start again. In 1701 the War of the Spanish Succession began. The Bourbon Philip of Anjou was designated heir to the throne of Spain. The Habsburg Emperor Leopold opposed a Bourbon succession, because the power that such a succession would bring to the Bourbon rulers of France would disturb the delicate balance of power in Europe. Therefore, he claimed the Spanish thrones for himself. England and the Dutch Republic joined Leopold against Louis XIV and Philip of Anjou. The allied forces were led by John Churchill and by Prince Eugene of Savoy. They inflicted a few resounding defeats to the French army; the Battle of Blenheim in 1704 was the first major land battle lost by France since its victory at Rocroi in 1643. Yet, after the extremely bloody battles of Ramillies and Malplaquet, Pyrrhic victories for the allies, they had lost too many men to continue the war. Led by Villars, the French forces recovered much of the lost ground in battles such as Denain. Finally, a compromise was achieved with the Ultrecht in 1713. Philip of Anjou was confirmed as Philip V, king of Spain, and Emperor Leopold did not get the throne, but Philip V was barred from inheriting France. { Wolf, Louis XIV (1968) } [ Ancien Régime ] [ Ancien Régime in France ] France in the Ancien Régime covered a territory of around [ 200000 sqmi km2 ], and supported 20 million people in 1700. At least 80% of the population were peasants. France had the second largest population in Europe around 1700. Britain had five or six million, Spain had eight million, and the Austrian Habsburgs had around eight million. Russia was the most populated European country at the time. France&apos;s lead slowly faded after 1700, as other countries grew faster. { Pierre Goubert, The Ancien Regime (1973) pp. 2-9. } The population was predominantly rural. In the 17th century rich peasants who had ties to the market economy provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village (or town). Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The &quot; stable &quot; core of French society, town guildspeople and village laboureurs, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal. Accepting the existence of these two societies, the constant tension between them, and extensive geographic and social mobility tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the social structure, economy, and even political system of early modern France. Collins (1991) argues that the Annales School paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy; and grossly exaggerated social stability. { James B. Collins, &quot; Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-Modern France, &quot; Journal of Social History (1991) 24#3 pp 563-577 in JSTOR For the Annales interpretation see Pierre Goubert, The French Peasantry in the Seventeenth Century (1986) excerpt and text search } [ Wars ] [ Seven Years&apos; War ] [ French Renaissance French colonization of the Americas Age of Enlightenment ] Louis XIV died in 1715 and was succeeded by his five-year-old great grandson who reigned as Louis XV until his death in 1774. In 1718, France was once again at war, as Philip II of Orléans &apos;s regency joined the War of the Quadruple Alliance against Spain. King Philip V of Spain had to withdraw from the conflict confronted with the reality that Spain was no longer a great power of Europe. Under Cardinal Fleury &apos;s administration, peace was maintained as long as possible. However, in 1733 another war broke in central Europe, this time about the Polish succession, and France joined the war against the Austrian Empire. This time there was no invasion of the Netherlands, and Britain remained neutral. As a consequence, Austria was left alone against a Franco-Spanish alliance and faced a military disaster. Peace was settled in the Treaty of Vienna (1738), according to which France would annex, through inheritance, the Duchy of Lorraine. { Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, The Ancien Regime: A History of France 1610–1774 (1999) } Two years later, in 1740, war broke out over the Austrian succession, and France seized the opportunity to join the conflict. The war played out in North America and India as well as Europe, and inconclusive terms were agreed to in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748). Once again, no one regarded this as a peace, but rather as a mere truce. Prussia was then becoming a new threat, as it had gained substantial territory from Austria. This led to the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, in which the alliances seen during the previous war were mostly inverted. France was now allied to Austria and Russia while Britain was now allied to Prussia. In the North American theatre, France was allied with various Native American peoples during the Seven Years&apos; War and, despite a temporary success at the battles of the Great Meadows and Monongahela, French forces were defeated at the disastrous Battle of the Plains of Abraham in Quebec. In Europe, repeated French attempts to overwhelm Hanover failed. In 1762 Russia, France and Austria were on the verge of crushing Prussia, when the Anglo-Prussian Alliance was saved by the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg. At sea naval defeats against British fleets at Lagos and Quiberon Bay in 1759 and a crippling blockade forced France to keep its ships in port. Finally peace was concluded in the Treaty of Paris (1763), and France lost its North American empire. { Daniel Marston, The Seven Years&apos; War (2001) } Britain&apos;s success had allowed them to eclipse France as the leading colonial power. France sought revenge for this defeat, and under Choiseul France started to rebuild. In 1766 the French Kingdom annexed Lorraine and the following year bought Corsica from Genoa. { Lord Cornwallis surrenders at } { Yorktown to American and French allies. } Having lost its colonial empire, France saw a good opportunity for revenge against Britain in signing an alliance with the Americans in 1778, and sending an army and navy that turned the American Revolution into a world war. Spain, allied to France by the Family Compact, and the Dutch Republic also joined the war on the French side. Admiral de Grasse defeated a British fleet at Chesapeake Bay while Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau and Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette joined American forces in defeating the British at Yorktown. The war was concluded by the Treaty of Paris (1783), under which Britain lost its former American colonies. Despite this the war had largely been a disappointment for France, it had been extremely expensive and they had only received Tobago for their efforts. { Jonathan R. Dull, A Diplomatic History of American Revolution (1985) } While the state expanded, new ideas broke on the role of the king and the powers of the state. Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu described the separation of powers. Many other French philosophers and intellectuals gained social, political and philosophical influence on a global scale, including Voltaire, Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose essay The Social Contract, Or Principles of Political Right was a catalyst for governmental and societal reform throughout Europe. Science, mathematics and technology also flourished. French scientists such as Antoine Lavoisier worked to replace the archaic units of weights and measures by a coherent scientific system, commissioned by king Louis XVI. Lavoisier also formulated the law of Conservation of mass and discovered oxygen and hydrogen. { Daniel Roche, France in the Enlightenment (1998) ch 15 } The Early Modern period in French history spans the following reigns, from 1461 to the Revolution, breaking in 1789: Louis XI the Prudent Charles VIII the Affable Louis XII Francis I Henry II and Catherine de&apos; Medici Francis II Charles IX Henry III { House of Bourbon } Henry IV the Great the Regency of Marie de Medici Louis XIII the Just and his minister Cardinal Richelieu the Regency of Anne of Austria and her minister Cardinal Mazarin Louis XIV the Sun King and his minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert the Régence of Philip II of Orléans Louis XV the Beloved and his minister Cardinal André-Hercule de Fleury Louis XVI [ Enlightenment ] [ Age of Enlightenment ] 250px The &quot; Philosophes &quot; were eighteenth century French intellectuals who dominated the French Enlightenment and were influential across Europe. Their interests were diverse, with experts in scientific, literary, philosophical and sociological matters. The ultimate goal of the philosophes was human progress; by concentrating on social and material sciences, they believed that a rational society was the only logical outcome of a freethinking and reasoned populace. They also advocated Deism and religious tolerance. Many believed religion had been used as a source of conflict since time eternal, and that logical, rational thought was the way forward for mankind. { Peter Hanns Reill and Ellen Judy Wilson, Encyclopædia of the Enlightenment(2nd ed. 2004) } The philosophe Denis Diderot was Editor in Chief of the famous Enlightenment accomplishment, the 72,000 article Encyclopédie (1751-1772). It sparked a revolution in learning throughout the enlightened world. { Arthur Wilson, Diderot, the Appeal to Posterity, 1759-1784 (1972) } In the early part of the 18th century the movement was dominated by Voltaire and Montesquieu, but the movement grew in momentum as the century moved on. Overall the Philosophes were inspired by the thoughts of René Descartes, the skepticism of the Libertins and the popularisation of science by Bernard de Fontenelle. Sectarian dissensions within the church, the gradual weakening of the absolute monarch and the numerous wars of Louis XIV allowed their influence to spread. Between 1748-1751 the Philosophes reached their most influential period, as Montesquieu published Spirit of Laws (1748) and Jean Jacques Rousseau published Discourse on the Moral Effects of the Arts and Sciences (1750). The representative leaders of the French Enlightenment--a writer of enormous influence across Europe--was Voltaire (1694-1778). His many books included poems and plays, works of satire ( Candide [1759]) and books on history, science and philosophy, including numerous (anonymous) contributions to the Encyclopédie, and an extensive correspondence. A witty, tireless antagonist to the alliance between the French state and the church, he was exiled from France on a number of occasions. In exile in England he came to appreciate British thought and he popularized Isaac Newton in Europe. { Nicholas Cronk, ed. The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire (2009) } [ Revolution and Napoleon (1789–1815) ] [ The Revolution ] [ French Revolution ] { Storming of the Bastille, 14 July 1789 } The immediate trigger for the Revolution was Louis XVI&apos;s attempts to solve the government&apos;s worsening financial situation. In February 1787 his finance minister, Charles Alexandre de Calonne, convened an Assembly of Notables, a group of nobles, clergy, bourgeoisie, and bureaucrats selected in order to bypass the local parliaments. This group was asked to approve a new land tax that would, for the first time, include a tax on the property of nobles and clergy. The assembly did not approve the tax, instead demanding that Louis XVI call the Estates-General. In August 1788 the King agreed to convene the Estates-General in May 1789. While the Third Estate demanded and was granted &quot; double representation &quot; so as to balance the First and Second Estate, voting was to occur &quot; by orders &quot; – votes of the Third Estate were to be weighted – effectively canceling double representation. This eventually led to the Third Estate breaking away from the Estates-General and, joined by members of the other estates, proclaiming the creation of the National Assembly, an assembly not of the Estates but of &quot; the People. &quot; In an attempt to keep control of the process and prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des États where the Assembly met. After finding the door to their chamber locked and guarded, the Assembly met nearby on a tennis court and pledged the Tennis Court Oath on 20 June 1789, binding them &quot; never to separate, and to meet wherever circumstances demand, until the constitution of the kingdom is established and affirmed on solid foundations. &quot; They were joined by some sympathetic members of the Second and First estates. After the king fired his finance minister, Jacques Necker, for giving his support and guidance to the Third Estate, worries surfaced that the legitimacy of the newly formed National Assembly might be threatened by royalists. Paris was soon consumed with riots, anarchy, and widespread looting. Because the royal leadership essentially abandoned the city, the mobs soon had the support of the French Guard, including arms and trained soldiers. On 14 July 1789, the insurgents set their eyes on the large weapons and ammunition cache inside the Bastille fortress, which also served as a symbol of royal tyranny. Insurgents seized the Bastille prison, killing the governor and several of his guards. The French now celebrate 14 July each year as a symbol of the shift away from the Ancien Regime to a more modern, democratic state. Gilbert du Motier, a hero of the War of American Independence, took command of the National Guard, and the king was forced to recognize the Tricolour Cockade. Although peace was made, several nobles did not regard the new order as acceptable and emigrated in order to push the neighboring, aristocratic kingdoms to war against the new democratic regime. Because of this new period of instability, the state was struck for several weeks in July and August 1789 by the Great Fear, a period of violent class conflict. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen was adopted by the National Assembly in August 1789 as a first step in their effort to write a constitution. Considered to be a precursor to modern international rights instruments and using the U.S. Declaration of Independence as a model, it defined a set of individual rights and collective rights of all of the estates as one. Influenced by the doctrine of natural rights, these rights were deemed universal and valid in all times and places, pertaining to human nature itself. The Assembly also replaced France&apos;s historic provinces with eighty-three departments, uniformly administered and approximately equal to one another in extent and population. On 4 August 1789, the Assembly abolished feudalism, in what became known as the August Decrees, sweeping away both the seigneurial rights of the Second Estate and the tithes gathered by the First Estate. In the course of a few hours, nobles, clergy, towns, provinces, companies, and cities lost their special privileges. The Assembly abolished the symbolic paraphernalia of the Ancien Régime, armorial bearings, liveries, etc., which alienated the more conservative nobles. Amidst these intrigues, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organization made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself. Jury trials started for criminal cases. The King would have the unique power to propose war, with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war. The Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers and suppressed guilds, masterships, and workers&apos; organizations. Consequently, an individual could only gain the right to practice a trade through the purchase of a license and worker strikes became illegal. The Revolution brought about a massive shifting of powers from the Roman Catholic Church to the state. Under the Ancien Régime, the Church had been the largest landowner in the country. Legislation enacted in 1790 abolished the Church&apos;s authority to levy a tax on crops, cancelled special privileges for the clergy, and confiscated Church property. The Assembly essentially addressed the financial crisis in part by having the nation take over the property of the Church. The republican government also enforced the Système International d&apos;Unités, commissioned by Louis XVI, which became known as the Metric System. Charles-Augustin de Coulomb and André-Marie Ampère &apos;s works on electricity and electromagnetism were also recognised, and their units are integrated into the Metric System. When a mob from Paris attacked the royal palace at Versailles in October 1789 seeking redress for their severe poverty, the royal family was forced to move to the Tuileries Palace in Paris. Later in June 1791, the royal family secretly fled Paris in disguise for Varennes near France&apos;s northeastern border in order to seek royalist support the king believed he could trust, but they were soon discovered en route. They were brought back to Paris, after which they were essentially kept under house-arrest at the Tuileries. Factions within the Assembly began to clarify. The opposition to revolution sat on the right-hand side of the Assembly. The &quot; Royalist democrats &quot; or monarchiens inclined toward organizing France along lines similar to the British constitutional model. The &quot; National Party &quot;, representing the centre or centre-left of the assembly represented somewhat more extreme views. The increasingly middle-class National Guard under Lafayette also slowly emerged as a power in its own right. With most of the Assembly still favoring a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic, the various groupings reached a compromise that left Louis XVI little more than a figurehead. He had perforce to swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to de facto abdication. Under the Constitution of 1791, France would function as a constitutional monarchy. The King had to share power with the elected Legislative Assembly, but he still retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers. The Legislative Assembly first met on 1 October 1791 and degenerated into chaos less than a year later. The Legislative Assembly consisted of about 165 Feuillants (constitutional monarchists) on the right, about 330 Girondists (liberal republicans) in the center, a vocal group of Jacobins (radical revolutionaries) on the left, and about 250 deputies unaffiliated with any of those factions. Early on, the King vetoed legislation that threatened the émigrés with death and that decreed that every non-juring clergyman must take within eight days the civic oath mandated by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Over the course of a year, disagreements like this would result in a constitutional crisis, leading the Revolution to higher levels. On the foreign affairs front, in the Declaration of Pillnitz of August 1791 Emperor Leopold II, Count Charles of Artois and King William II of Prussia made Louis XVI&apos;s cause their own. These noblemen also required the Assembly to be dissolved through threats of war, but, instead of cowing the French, it infuriated them. The borders were militarised as a consequence. Under the Constitution of 1791, the solution of a constitutional monarchy was adopted, and the king supported a war against Austria in order to increase his popularity, starting the long French Revolutionary Wars. On the night of the 10 August, the Jacobins, who had mainly opposed the war, suspended the monarchy. With the Prussian army entering France, more doubts were raised against the aristocracy, and these tensions climaxed during the September Massacres. After the first great victory of the French revolutionary troops at the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792, the French First Republic was proclaimed the next day, on 21 September 1792. The new French Republican Calendar was then legally enforced. The Mountain is the English translation for the French word, Montagne, which was the radical political faction of the National Convention who considered themselves the true patriots of the French Revolution. { Andress, David. The Terror. p. 118 } Customarily, its members, called Montagnards, sat on the highest tiered benches in the Convention hall, therefore giving the party its name. An alternate meaning of the name, one more metaphorical, implied that mountains are a natural, pure landscape preferred to the corruption of the city, which was represented by its opposing faction, the Girondins. { Andress, David. The Terror. p. 131 } The Mountain had 302 members during its reign in 1793 and 1794, including committee members and deputies who voted with the faction. { Patrick, Alison. &quot; Political Divisions in the French National Convention 1792–93 &quot; p. 436 } Most of its members came from the middle class and tended to represent the Parisian population. { Palmer, R.R. Twelve Who Ruled. p. 26 } Its leaders included Maximilien Robespierre, Jean-Paul Marat, and Georges Danton. { Palmer, R.R. Twelve Who Ruled. p. 25 } This party eventually gained overwhelming power in the Convention and governed France during the Reign of Terror. The Montagnards and the Girondins were both originally Jacobins, a political club which was founded according to republican beliefs and whose members wanted a French democratic republic. [ Jack Richard Censer Lynn Avery Hunt Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution http://books.google.com/books?id%3DOSDNl6Ydq_oC 2001 Penn State U.P. 64 ] The Jacobin Club, however, encountered political tension beginning in 1791 due to conflicting viewpoints in response to several revolutionary events and how to best achieve a democratic republic. { David Andress, The Terror p. 381 } As a result, two factions emerged: the Girondins and the Montagnards. The latter sided with the Parisian militants, also known as the sans-culottes, who aimed for a more repressive form of government that would institute a price maximum on essential consumer goods and would punish all traitors and enemies of the Republic. { Censer, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity pp. 64,74 } Additionally, between war and political differences, the Montagnards believed these crises required emergency solutions. { Hugh Gough, The Terror in the French Revolution p. 31 } Possibly the two most significant factors in the quarrel and consequential split between the Montagnards and the Girondins include the Trial of King Louis XVI and the September Massacres. The official fall of the monarchy came on 10 August 1792 after Louis XVI refused to rescind his veto of the constitution of the National Assembly. The Mountain argued for immediate execution of the king by military court-martial, insisting that he was undermining the Revolution. Because a trial would require the &quot; presumption of innocence, &quot; such a proceeding would contradict the mission of the National Convention. The Girondins, in contrast, agreed that the king was guilty of treason but argued for his clemency and favored the option of exile or popular referendum as his sentence. { Censer, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, pp. 64–66 } However, the trial progressed and Louis XVI was executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793. The second key factor in the split between the Montagnards and the Girondins was the September Massacres of 1792. Radical Parisians, members of the National Guard, and fédérés were angry with the poor progress in the war against Austria and Prussia and the forced enlistment of 30,000 volunteers. On 10 August, radicals went on a killing spree, slaughtering roughly 1,300 inmates in various Paris prisons, many of whom were simply common criminals, not the treasonous counterrevolutionaries condemned by the Mountain. { Patrice Higonnet, Goodness Beyond Virtue p. 37 } The Girondins did not tolerate the massacres, but neither the Montagnards of the Legislative Assembly nor the Paris Commune took any action to stop or condemn the killings. Members of the Girondins later accused Marat, Robespierre, and Danton as inciters of the massacres in an attempt to further their dictatorial power. { Paul R. Hanson, The Jacobin Republic Under Fire p. 40-41 } Members of the Mountain went on to establish the Committee of Public Safety under Robespierre, which would be responsible for the Terror, the bloodiest and one of the most controversial phases of the French Revolution. The time between 1792 and 1794 was dominated by the ideology of the Mountain until the execution of Robespierre on 28 July 1794. { Louis XV, had stood. } When the Brunswick Manifesto of July 1792 once more threatened the French population with Austrian (Imperial) and Prussian attacks, Louis XVI was suspected of treason and taken along with his family from the Tuileries Palace in August 1792 by insurgents supported by a new revolutionary Paris Commune. The King and Queen ended up prisoners, and a rump session of the Legislative Assembly suspended the monarchy. Little more than a third of the deputies were present, almost all of them Jacobins. The King was later tried and convicted and, on 21 January 1793, was executed by the guillotine. Marie Antoinette, would follow him to the guillotine on 16 October. What remained of a national government depended on the support of the insurrectionary Commune. When the Commune sent gangs into prisons to arbitrarily adjudicate and butcher 1400 victims, and then addressed a circular letter to the other cities of France, inviting them to follow this example, the Assembly could offer only feeble resistance. This situation persisted until a National Convention, charged with writing a new constitution, met on 20 September 1792 and became the new de facto government of France. The next day it abolished the monarchy and declared a republic. When the war went badly, prices rose, and the sans-culottes (poor labourers and radical Jacobins) rioted, counter-revolutionary activities began in some regions. This encouraged the Jacobins to seize power through a parliamentary coup, backed up by force effected by mobilising public support against the Girondist faction, and by utilising the mob power of the Parisian sans-culottes. An alliance of Jacobin and sans-culottes elements thus became the effective centre of the new government. Policy became considerably more radical. In September 1793 a period known as the Reign of Terror ensued for approximately 12 months. The Committee of Public Safety, set up by the National Convention on 6 April 1793, formed the de facto executive government of France. Under war conditions and with national survival seemingly at stake, the Jacobins under Maximilien Robespierre centralized denunciations, trials, and executions under the supervision of this committee of twelve members. At least 18,000 people met their deaths under the guillotine or otherwise, after accusations of counter-revolutionary activities. In 1794, Robespierre had ultra-radicals and moderate Jacobins executed. As a consequence of these actions, however, Robespierre&apos;s own popular support eroded markedly. On 27 July 1794, the Thermidorian Reaction led to the arrest and execution of Robespierre. The new government was predominantly made up of Girondists who had survived the Terror and, after taking power, they took revenge as well by banning the Jacobin Club and executing many of its former members in what was known as the White Terror. After the stated aim of the National Convention to export revolution, the guillotining of Louis XVI of France, and the French opening of the Scheldt, a military coalition was formed and set up against France. Spain, Naples, Great Britain and the Netherlands joined Austria and Prussia in The First Coalition (1792–1797), the first major concerted effort of multiple European powers to contain Revolutionary France. It took shape after the wars had already begun. The Republican government in Paris was radicalised after a diplomatic coup from the Jacobins and said it would be the Guerre Totale and called for a Levée en masse. Royalist invasion forces were defeated at Toulon in 1793, leaving the French republican forces in an offensive position and granting a young officer, Napoleon Bonaparte, a certain fame. Following their victory at Fleurus, the Republicans occupied Belgium and the Rhineland. An invasion of the Netherlands established the puppet Batavian Republic. Finally, a peace agreement was concluded between France, Spain and Prussia in 1795 at Basel. The Convention approved a new &quot; Constitution of the Year III &quot; on 17 August 1795; it was ratified by a national plebiscite and took effect on 26 September 1795. [ Gregory Fremont-Barnes Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815 http://books.google.com/books?id%3D6_2wkP4j-EsC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA159 2007 Greenwood Publishing Group 159 ] The new constitution created the Directory and the first bicameral legislature in French history. The parliament consisted of 500 representatives – le Conseil des Cinq-Cents (the Council of the Five Hundred) – and 250 senators – le Conseil des Anciens (the Council of Elders). Executive power went to five &quot; directors &quot;, named annually by the Conseil des Anciens from a list submitted by le Conseil des Cinq-Cents. The nation desired rest and the healing of its many wounds. Those who wished to restore Louis XVIII and the Ancien Régime and those who would have renewed the Reign of Terror were insignificant in number. The possibility of foreign interference had vanished with the failure of the First Coalition. Nevertheless, the four years of the Directory were a time of arbitrary government and chronic disquiet. The late atrocities had made confidence or goodwill between the parties impossible. As the majority of French people wanted to be rid of them, they could achieve their purpose only by extraordinary means. The Convention habitually disregarded the terms of the constitution, and, when the elections went against them, appealed to the sword. They resolved to prolong the war as the best expedient for prolonging their power. They were thus driven to rely upon the armies, which also desired war and were becoming increasingly less civic in temper. The Directory lasted until 1799 when Napoleon staged a coup and installed the Consulate. The Consulate still operated within the First Republic, was replaced by the First Empire, established by Napoleon in 1804. [ David Nicholls Napoleon: A Biographical Companion http://books.google.com/books?id%3DPmCdv91zPS0C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA81 1999 ABC-CLIO 81 ] [ The Napoleonic Era ] [ Napoleonic wars ] { Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres } During the War of the First Coalition the Directoire had replaced the National Convention. Five directors then ruled France. As Great Britain was still at war with France, a plan was made to take Egypt from the Ottoman Empire, a British ally. This was Napoleon &apos;s idea and the Directoire agreed to the plan in order to send the popular general away from the mainland. Napoleon defeated the Ottoman forces during the Battle of the Pyramids and sent hundreds of scientists and linguists out to thoroughly explore modern and ancient Egypt. Unexpectedly the British fleet under Admiral Nelson, destroyed the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile. Napoleon planned to move into Syria but was defeated and he returned to France without his army. It surrendered. { Paul Strathern, Napoleon in Egypt (2009) } The Directoire was threatened by the Second Coalition. Royalists and their allies still dreamed of restoring the monarchy to power, while the Prussian and Austrian crowns did not accept their territorial losses during the previous war. The Russian army expelled the French from Italy in battles such as Cassano while the Austrian army defeated the French in Switzerland at Stockach and Zurich. Napoleon then seized power through a coup and established the Consulate in 1799. The Austrian army was defeated at Marengo in 1800 and again at Hohenlinden. While at sea the French had some success at Boulogne but Nelson&apos;s Royal Navy destroyed an anchored Danish and Norwegian fleet at Copenhagen because the Scandinavian kingdoms were against the British blockade on France. The Second Coalition was beaten and peace was settled in two distinct treaties: The Treaty of Lunéville and the Treaty of Amiens. A brief interlude of peace ensued in 1802-3, during which Napoleon sold French Louisiana to the United States because it was indefensible. { George F. Nafziger, Historical Dictionary of the Napoleonic Era (2002) } In 1801 Napoleon concluded a &quot; Concordat &quot; with Pope Pius VII that opened peaceful relations between church and state in France. The policies of the Revolution were reversed—except the Church did not get its lands back. Bishops and clergy were to receive state salaries and the government paid for the building and maintenance of churches. { Nigel Aston, Religion and revolution in France, 1780-1804 (2000) p 324 } Napoleon reorganized higher learning by dividing the Institut National into four (later five) academies. Of permanent importance was the Napoleonic Code created by eminent jurists under Napoleon&apos;s supervision. Praised for its Gallic clarity, it spread rapidly throughout Europe and the world in general, and marked the end of feudalism and the liberation of Jews where it took effect. { Alexander Grab, Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe (2003) } The Code recognized the principles of civil liberty, equality before the law, and the secular character of the state. It discarded the old right of primogeniture (where only the eldest son inherited) and required that inheritances be divided equally among all the children. The court system was standardized; all judges were appointed by the national government in Paris. { Pierre Goubert, The Course of French History (1991) ch 14 } In 1804 Napoleon was titled Emperor by the senate, thus founding the French Empire. Napoleon&apos;s rule was constitutional, and although autocratic, it was much more advanced than traditional European monarchies of the time. The proclamation of the French Empire was met by the Third Coalition. The French army was renamed the Grande Armée in 1805 and Napoleon used propaganda and nationalism to control the French population. The French army achieved a resounding victory at Ulm, where an entire Austrian army was captured. However, a Franco-Spanish fleet was defeated at Trafalgar and all plans to invade Britain were then made impossible. Despite this naval defeat, it was on the ground that this war would be won, Napoleon inflicted the Austrian and Russian Empires one of their greatest defeats at Austerlitz, destroying the third coalition. The peace was settled in the Treaty of Pressburg, the Austrian Empire lost the title of Holy Roman Emperor and the Confederation of the Rhine was created by Napoleon over former Austrian territories. { Robert P. Goetz, 1805: Austerlitz: Napoleon and the Destruction of the Third Coalition, (2005) } { Battle of Austerlitz, by } { François Gérard } Prussia joined Britain and Russia, thus forming the Fourth Coalition. Although the Coalition was joined by other allies, the French Empire was also not alone since it now had a complex network of allies and submitted states. Largely outnumbered, the Prussian army was crushed at Jena-Auerstedt in 1806, Napoleon captured Berlin and went as far as Eastern Prussia. There the Russian Empire was defeated at the Battle of Friedland. Peace was dictated in the Treaties of Tilsit, in which Russia had to join the Continental System and Prussia handed down half of its territories to France. The Duchy of Warsaw was formed over these territorial losses, and the Polish troops entered the Grande Armée in significant numbers. { First Empire } Freed from his obligation in the east, Napoleon then went back to the west, as the French Empire was still at war with Britain. Only two countries remained neutral in the war: Sweden and Portugal, and Napoleon then looked toward the latter. In the Treaty of Fontainebleau, a Franco-Spanish alliance against Portugal was sealed as Spain eyed Portuguese territories. French armies entered Spain in order to attack Portugal, but then seized Spanish fortresses and took over the kingdom by surprise. Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon&apos;s brother, was made King of Spain after Charles IV &apos;s abdication. This occupation of the Iberian peninsula fueled local nationalism, and soon the Spanish and Portuguese would fight the French using guerilla tactics, defeating the French forces at the Battle of Bailén. Britain sent a short-lived ground support force to Portugal, and French forces evacuated Portugal as defined in the Convention of Sintra following the Allied victory at Vimeiro. France was only controlling Catalonia and Navarre and could have been definitely expelled from the Iberian peninsula had the Spanish armies attacked again, but the Spanish did not. Another French attack was launched on Spain, led by Napoleon himself, and was described as &quot; an avalanche of fire and steel. &quot; However, the French Empire was no longer regarded as invincible by European powers. In 1808 Austria formed the War of the Fifth Coalition in order to break down the French Empire. The Austrian Empire defeated the French at Aspern-Essling, yet was beaten at Wagram while the Polish allies defeated the Austrian Empire at Raszyn. Although not as decisive as the previous Austrian defeats, the peace treaty caused Austria to lose a large amount of territories, reducing it even more. { Adolf Northern } In 1812 war broke out with Russia, engaging Napoleon in the disastrous Patriotic War. Napoleon assembled the largest army Europe had ever seen, including troops from all submitted states, to invade Russia, which had just left the continental system and was gathering an army on the Polish frontier. Following an exhausting march and the bloody but inconclusive Battle of Borodino, near Moscow, the Grande Armée entered and captured Moscow, just to find it burning, as part of the Russian scorched earth tactics. Although there still were battles such as Maloyaroslavets the Napoleonic army left Russia decimated most of all by the Russian winter, exhaustion and scorched earth warfare. On the Spanish front the French troops were defeated at Vitoria and then at the Battle of the Pyrenees. Since the Spanish guerrillas seemed to be uncontrollable, the French troops eventually evacuated Spain. France having been defeated on these two fronts, the states controlled and previously conquered by Napoleon saw a good opportunity to strike back. The Sixth Coalition was formed and the German states of the Confederation of the Rhine switched sides, finally opposing Napoleon. Napoleon was largely defeated in the Battle of the Nations and was overwhelmed by much larger armies during the Six Days Campaign, although, because of the much larger amount of casualties suffered by the allies, the Six Days Campaign is often considered a tactical masterpiece. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814, and was exiled to Elba. The conservative Congress of Vienna reversed the political changes that had occurred during the wars. Napoleon&apos;s attempted restoration, a period known as the Hundred Days, ended with his final defeat at Waterloo in 1815. The monarchy was subsequently restored and Louis XVIII became king. [ Long nineteenth century, 1815–1914 ] [ France in the long nineteenth century ] The seemingly timeless world of the French peasantry swiftly changed from 1870 to 1914. French peasants had been poor and backward until railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription modernized rural France. The centralized government in Paris had the goal of creating a unified nation state, so it required all students be taught standardized French. In the process a new national identity was forged. { Eugen Weber, Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1890–1914 (1976). } [ Bourbon restoration: 1814–1830 ] This period of time is called the Bourbon Restoration and was marked by conflicts between reactionary Ultra-royalists, who wanted to restore the pre-1789 system of absolute monarchy, and liberals, who wanted to strengthen constitutional monarchy. Louis XVIII was the younger brother of Louis XVI, and reigned from 1814 to 1824. On becoming king, Louis issued a constitution known as the Charter which preserved many of the liberties won during the French Revolution and provided for a parliament composed of an elected Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Peers that was nominated by the king. However the right to vote in elections to the Chamber of Deputies was restricted to only the wealthiest men. Louis was succeeded in turn by a younger brother, Charles X, who reigned from 1824 to 1830. On 12 June 1830 Polignac, King Charles X &apos;s minister, exploited the weakness of the Algerian Dey by invading Algeria and establishing French rule in Algeria. { Albert Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959) p. 293. } However, the news of the fall of Algiers had barely reached Paris when a new revolution broke out and quickly resulted in a change of regime. [ July Monarchy 1830–1848 ] Protest against the absolute monarchy was in the air. The elections of deputies to the 16 May 1830 had gone very badly for King Charles X. { Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959) p. 287. } Charles X reacted by proroguing the Chamber of Deputies and sending them all packing, and then unilaterally changed the electional laws in an attempt to create a new Chamber of Deputies more favorable to him, and muzzled the press. Opposition to the absolute monarchy was immediately expressed in the streets of Paris as suppressed deputies, gagged journalists, students from the University and many working men of Paris poured into the streets and erected barricades during the &quot; three glorious days &quot; (French Les Trois Glorieuses) of 26–29 July 1830. Charles X was deposed and replaced by King Louis-Philippe in what is known as the July Revolution. The July Revolution is traditionally regarded as a rising of the bourgeoisie against the absolute monarchy of the Bourbons. Participants in the July Revolution included Marie Joseph Paul Ives Roch Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette. Working behind the scenes on behalf of the bourgeois propertied interests was Louis Adolphe Thiers. Thiers was perfectly willing to see changes made in the government so long as property was not harmed. Thiers wanted the &quot; middle class accommodated &quot; with the vote realizing that, ironically, although the petty bourgeoisie (the inn and cafe keepers, restaurant owners, wine merchants, small traders, shop keepers, handicraftsmen, etc.) were all being ruined by the rise of the larger bourgeoisie that the petty bourgeoisie remained strong supporters of property interests. Lafayette believed the Orleanist constitutional monarchy was the safest course for the propertied interests and so Lafayette and Thiers became supporters of the Orleanist &quot; Citizen King &quot; -- Louis-Philippe.Consequently, Louis-Philippe became &quot; king by the grace of the barricades. &quot; { Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959) p. 291. } Louis-Philippe&apos;s &quot; July Monarchy &quot; (1830–1848) was dominated by the haute bourgeoisie (high bourgeoisie) of bankers, financiers, industrialists and merchants. During the reign of the July Monarchy, the Romantic Era was starting to bloom. Driven by the Romantic Era, an atmosphere of protest and revolt was all around in France. On 22 November 1831 in Lyon (the second largest city in France) the silk workers revolted and took over the town hall in protest of recent salary reductions and working conditions. This was one of the first occasions of a workers revolt in the entire world. { Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959) p. 294. } The revolt was vigorously put down by Casimir Perier. The Right was also unhappy with the July Monarchy. On 28 October 1836, Prince Louis-Napoleon, son of Napoleon&apos;s brother, Louis, King of Holland attempted to overthrow the July Monarchy in a coup d&apos;état. It failed but in August 1840, Prince Louis Napoleon tried another coup at Boulogne with hired soldiers. It failed as well. { Phillip Guedalla, The Second Empire (1923) pp. 18-90, 120-26. } Because of the constant threats to the throne, the July Monarchy began to rule with a stronger and stronger hand. Soon political meetings were outlawed. However, &quot; banquets &quot; were still legal and all through 1847, there was a nation-wide campaign of democracy and/or republican banquets. The climaxing banquet was scheduled for 22 February 1848 in Paris but the government banned it. In response citizens of all classes poured out onto the streets of Paris in a revolt against the July Monarchy. Demands were made for abdication of &quot; Citizen King &quot; Louis-Phillipe and for establishment of a representative democracy in France. [ Maurice Agulhon The Republican Experiment, 1848-1852 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DW9XFC28uLNIC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA23 1983 Cambridge University Press 23–40 ] Representative classes in this revolt included the full range of French society from the industrial bourgeoisie (who had been excluded from the &quot; finance aristocracy &quot; that formed the major part of the bourgeoisie that supported the July Monarchy), the petty bourgeoisie and the workers. Louis-Phillipe abdicated, and the French Second Republic was proclaimed. A Constituent Assembly was elected which was seated in Paris. Alphonse Marie Louis de Lamartine, who had been a leader of the moderate republicans in France during the 1840s became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Provisional Government that was established by this Assembly. In reality Lamartine was the virtual head of government in 1848. { Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer, France in the nineteenth century, 1830-1890 (1892) ch 7 pp 125-49 online } [ Napoleon III: 1848–1871 ] Napoleon III, Emperor of the French Frustration among the laboring classes arose when the Constituent Assembly did not address the concerns of the workers. Strikes and worker demonstrations became more common as the workers gave vent to these frustrations. These demonstrations reached a climax when on 15 May 1848, workers from the secret societies broke out in armed uprising against the anti-labor and anti-democratic policies being pursued by the Constituent Assembly and the Provisional Government. Fearful of a total breakdown of law and order, the Provisional Government invited General Louis Eugene Cavaignac back from Algeria, in June 1848, to put down the worker&apos;s armed revolt. From June 1848 until December 1848 General Cavaignac became head of the executive of the Provisional Government. { William Fortescue, France and 1848: the end of monarchy (2005) p. 130 } Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was elected president on 10 December 1848 by a landslide. His support came from a wide section of the French public. Various classes of French society voted for Louis Napoleon for very different and often contradictory reasons. { Fortescue, France and 1848: the end of monarchy (2005) p. 135 } Louis Napoleon, himself encouraged this contradiction by &quot; being all things to all people. &quot; One of his major promises to the peasantry and other groups was that there would be no new taxes. The new National Constituent Assembly was heavily composed of royalist symphathizers of both the Legitimist (Bourbon) wing and the Orleanist (Citizen King Louis Phiippe) wing. Because of the ambiguity surrounding Louis Napoleon&apos;s political positions, his agenda as president was very much in doubt. For prime minister, he selected Odilon Barrot, an unobjectionable middle-road parliamentarian, who had led the &quot; loyal opposition &quot; under Louis-Philippe. Other appointees represented various royalist factions. { T. A. B. Corley, Democratic Despot: A Life of Napoleon III (1961) pp 74-77 } As part of the Revolutions of 1848, The Pope was forced out of Rome and Louis Napoleon sent a 14,000 man expeditionary force of troops to the Papal State under General Nicolas Charles Victor Oudinot to restore him. In late April, 1849, it was defeated and pushed back from Rome by Giuseppi Garibaldi &apos;s volunteer corps, then recovered and recaptured Rome. { Guérard, France: A Modern History, p. 305. } In the &quot; June Days &quot; of 1849 demonstrations against the government broke out and were suppressed. Leaders were arrested, including prominent politicians. The government banned several democratic and socialist newspapers in France; the editors were arrested. Karl Marx was at risk so he moved to London in August. [ Maurice Agulhon The Republican Experiment, 1848-1852 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DW9XFC28uLNIC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA23 1983 Cambridge U.P. 78-80 ] The government sought ways to balance its budget and reduce its debts. Toward this end, Hippolyte Passy was appointed Finance Minister. When the Legislative Assembly met at the beginning of October, 1849, Passy proposed an income tax to help balance the finances in France. The bourgeoisie, who would pay most of the tax, protested. The furor over the income tax caused the resignation of Barrot as prime minister, but a new wine tax also caused protests. [ Maurice Agulhon The Republican Experiment, 1848-1852 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DW9XFC28uLNIC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA23 1983 Cambridge U.P. 117-38 ] The 1850 elections resulted in a conservative body. It passed the Falloux Laws giving education into the hand of the Catholic clergy. It opened an era of cooperation between Church and state that lasted until the Ferry laws reversed course in 1879. The Fallous laws provided universal primary schooling in France and expanded opportunities for secondary schooling. In practice, the curricula in Catholic and state schools were similar. Catholic schools were especially useful in schooling for girls, which had long been neglected. { Patrick J. Harrigan, &quot; Church, State, and Education in France From the Falloux to the Ferry Laws: A Reassessment, &quot; Canadian Journal of History, (2001) 36#1 pp 51-83 } Although a new electoral law was passed which respected the principle of universal (male) suffrage, the stricter residential requirement of the new law actually had the effect of disenfranchising 3,000,000 of 10,000,000 voters. { Albert Guérard, France: A Modern History, pp. 305-306. } As 1851 opened, Louis Napoleon was not allowed by the Constitution of 1848 to seek re-election as President of France. { Philip Guedalla, The Second Empire p. 203. } Instead he proclaimed himself President for Life following a coup in December that was confirmed and accepted in a dubious referendum. Napoleon III of France took the imperial title in 1852 and held it until his downfall in 1870. The era saw great industrialization, urbanization (including the massive rebuilding of Paris by Baron Haussmann ) and economic growth, but Napoleon III&apos;s foreign policies were not so successful. In 1854, The Second Empire joined the Crimean War, which saw France and Britain opposed to the Russian Empire, who were decisively defeated at Sevastopol in 1855 and at Inkerman. In 1856 France joined the Second Opium War on the British side against China; a missionary&apos;s murder was used as a pretext to take interests in southwest Asia in the Treaty of Tientsin. In 1859 the Second Italian War of Independence broke out between the northern Italian kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia and Austria. The Second French Empire joined the war on the Italian side, which was concluded by an Austrian defeat at Solferino. In return for this intervention, Piedmont ceded the County of Nice (which included the city of Nice and the rugged Alpine territory to its north and east) and the Duchy of Savoy. In 1861 Napoleon III largely supported Maximilian in his claim to Mexico, a move that was also supported by Britain and Spain but condemned by the U.S. This led to the French intervention in Mexico, which turned out to be a failure. When France was negotiating with The Netherlands about purchasing Luxembourg, the Prussian Kingdom threatened the French government with war. This came as a shock to French diplomats as there previously was an agreement between the Prussian and French governments about Luxembourg. Napoleon III suffered stronger and stronger criticism from Republicans like Jules Favre, and his position seemed more fragile with the passage of time. France was looking for more interests in Asia and interfered in Korea in 1866 taking, once again, missionaries&apos; murders as a pretext. The French finally withdrew from the war with little gain but war&apos;s booty. The next year a French expedition to Japan was formed to help the Tokugawa shogunate to modernize its army. However, Tokugawa was defeated during the Boshin War at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi by large Imperial armies. Rising tensions in 1869 about the possible candidacy of Prince Leopold von Hohenzollern -Sigmaringen to the throne of Spain, caused a rise in the scale of animosity between France and Germany. { H. w. Koch, A History of Prussia (Dorset Press, New York, 1978) pp. 265–266. } Prince Leopold was a part of the Prussian royal family. He had been asked by the Spanish Cortes to accept the vacant throne of Spain. Such an event was more than France could possibly accept. Relations between France and Germany deteriorated and finally, the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) broke out. German nationalism united the German states, with the exception of Austria, against Napoleon III. The French Empire was defeated decisively at Metz and Sedan. Indeed, Emperor Louis Napoleon III surrendered himself and 100,000 French troops to the German troops at Sedan on 1 September through 2, 1870. { Guèrard, p. 324. } Two days later, on 4 September 1870, Leon Gambetta proclaimed a new republic in France. { William L. Shirer, The Collapse of the Third Republic (Simon &amp; Shuster: New York, 1969) p. 36. } Later when Paris was encircled by German troops, Gambetta fled Paris by means of a hot air balloon and he became the virtual dictator of the war effort which was carried on from the rural provinces. { Guérard, p. 325. } Metz remained under siege until 27 October 1870, when 173,000 French troops were located there finally surrendered. Surrounded Paris and was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. The last straw was the Siege of Paris. The Treaty of Frankfurt allowed the newly formed German Empire to annex the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. { Guérard, p. 326. } [ Railways ] [ History of rail transport in France ] Railways became a national medium for the modernization of backward regions, and a leading advocate of this approach was the poet-politician Alphonse de Lamartine. One writer hoped that railways might improve the lot of &quot; populations two or three centuries behind their fellows &quot; and eliminate &quot; the savage instincts born of isolation and misery. &quot; Consequently, France built a centralized system that radiated from Paris (plus lines that cut east to west in the south). This design was intended to achieve political and cultural goals rather than maximize efficiency. After some consolidation, six companies controlled monopolies of their regions, subject to close control by the government in terms of fares, finances, and even minute technical details. The central government department of Ponts et Chaussées [roads and bridges] brought in British engineers and workers, handled much of the construction work, provided engineering expertise and planning, land acquisition, and construction of permanent infrastructure such as the track bed, bridges and tunnels. It also subsidized militarily necessary lines along the German border, which was considered necessary for the national defense. Private operating companies provided management, hired labor, laid the tracks, and built and operated stations. They purchased and maintained the rolling stock—6,000 locomotives were in operation in 1880, which averaged 51,600 passengers a year or 21,200 tons of freight. Much of the equipment was imported from Britain and therefore did not stimulate machinery makers. Although starting the whole system at once was politically expedient, it delayed completion, and forced even more reliance on temporary experts brought in from Britain. Financing was also a problem. The solution was a narrow base of funding through the Rothschilds and the closed circles of the Bourse in Paris, so France did not develop the same kind of national stock exchange that flourished in London and New York. The system did help modernize the parts of rural France it reached, but it did not help create local industrial centers. Critics such as Emile Zola complained that it never overcame the corruption of the political system, but rather contributed to it. The railways probably helped the industrial revolution in France by facilitating a national market for raw materials, wines, cheeses, and imported manufactured products. Yet the goals set by the French for their railway system were moralistic, political, and military rather than economic. As a result, the freight trains were shorter and less heavily loaded than those in such rapidly industrializing nations such as Britain, Belgium or Germany. Other infrastructure needs in rural France, such as better roads and canals, were neglected because of the expense of the railways, so it seems likely that there were net negative effects in areas not served by the trains. { Patrick O’Brien, Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830–1914 (1983) } [ The Third Republic and the Belle Epoque ] [ French Third Republic ] Following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, Otto von Bismarck proposed harsh terms for peace—including the German occupation of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. A new French National Assembly was elected to consider the German terms for peace. Elected on 8 February 1871, this new National Assembly was composed of 650 deputies. Sitting in Bourdeaux, the French National Assembly established the Third Republic. However, 400 members of the new Assembly were monarchists. { William L. Shirer, The Collapse of the Third Republic Simon and Schuster: New York, 1969) p. 35. } ( Leon Gambetta was one of the &quot; non-monarchist &quot; Republicans that were elected to the new National Assembly from Paris. { Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959) p. 326. } ) On 16 February 1871 Adolphe Thiers was elected to be the chief executive of the new Republic. Because of the revolutionary unrest in Paris, the center of the Thiers government was located at Versailles. A barricade in the Paris Commune, March 18, 1871. [ Crushing of the Paris Commune ] In late 1870-early 1871 the workers of Paris rose up in premature and unsuccessful small-scale uprisings. The National Guard within Paris had become increasingly restive and defiant of the police, the army chief of staff and even their own National Guard commanders. Thiers immediately recognized a revolutionary situation and on 18 March 1871, sent regular army units to take control of artillery that belonged to the National Guard of Paris. However, some soldiers of the regular army units fraternized with the rebels and the revolt escalated. The barricades went up just as in 1830 and 1848. The Paris Commune was born. Once again the Hotel de Ville, or Town Hall became center of attention for the people in revolt. This time the Hotel de Ville became the seat of the revolutionary government. Other cities in France followed the example of the Paris Commune, as in Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse. However, all of these Communes outside Paris were promptly crushed by the Thiers government. { Eugene Schulkind, ed. The Paris Commune 1871 pp. 22–23. } An election on 26 March 1871 in Paris produced a government based on the working class. [ May 2012 ] Louis Auguste Blanqui was in prison but a majority of delegates were his followers, called &quot; Blanquists. [ May 2012 ] The minority comprised anarchists and followers of Pierre Joseph Proudhon (1809–1855). [ May 2012 ] As anarchists, the &quot; Proudhonists &quot; were supporters of limited or no government and wanted the revolution to follow an ad hoc course with little or no planning. [ May 2012 ] Analysis of arrests records indicate the typical communard was opposed to the military, the clerics, the rural aristocrats. [ May 2012 ] He saw as the enemy the bourgeoisie. [ May 2012 ] After two months the French army moved in to retake Paris, with pitched battles fought in working class neighborhoods. Hundreds were executed in front of the Communards&apos; Wall, while thousands of others were marched to Versailles for trials. The number killed during La Semaine Sanglante (The Bloody Week of 21 May through 28 May 1871) was perhaps 30,000, with as many as 50,000 later executed or imprisoned; 7,000 were exiled to New Caledonia. Thousands more escaped to exile. The government won approval for its actions in a national referendum with 321,000 in favor and only 54,000 opposed. { Patrick H. Hutton et al., eds. Historical Dictionary of the Third French Republic, 1870-1940 (Greenwood, 1986) p. 215. } [ Political battles ] The Republican government next had to confront counterrevolutionaries who rejected the legacy of the 1789 Revolution. Both the Legitimist, embodied in the person of Henri, Count of Chambord, grandson of Charles X; and the Orleanist royalist s rejected republicanism, which they saw as an extension of modernity and atheism, breaking with France&apos;s traditions. This conflict became increasingly sharp in 1873, when Thiers, himself was censured by the National Assembly as not being &quot; sufficiently conservative &quot; and resigned to make way for Marshal Patrice MacMahon as the new president. { Guerard, France: A Modern History (1959), pp. 328–329 } Amidst the rumors of right wing intrigue and/or coups by the Bonapartists or the Bourbons in 1874, the National Assembly set about drawing up a new constitution which would be acceptable to all parties. The new constitution provided for universal male suffrage and called for a bi-cameral legislature, consisting of a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies. The first election under this new constitution held in early 1876 resulted in a republican victory, with 363 republicans elected as opposed to 180 monarchists. However, 75 of the monarchists elected to the new Chamber of Deputies were Bonapartists. { William L. Shirer, The Collapse of the Third Republic p. 39. } The &quot; Bonapartist threat &quot; of a coup de etat was an ever-present danger in these early days of the Republic. Under the constitution, President MacMahon was required to pick a &quot; premier &quot; to actually lead the day-to-day affairs of the government. The most natural leader to pick following this republican victory at the polls would have been Leon Gambetta. However, the old Marshal was dead set against Gambetta and chose, instead, moderate Armand Dufaure. Dufaure tried to form a government but he was quickly overthrown. Next Marshall MacMahon chose conservative Jules Simon. He was too conservative for the Chamber of Deputies and Simon was forced to resign on 16 May 1877, setting the stage for the &quot; Crisis of the Sixteenth of May. &quot; [ William Fortescue The Third Republic in France, 1870-1940: Conflicts and Continuities http://books.google.com/books?id%3DVzfBh4eQsPQC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA33 2000 Psychology Press ] The 16 May 1877 crisis eventually led to the resignation of royalist Marshal MacMahon in January 1879. During his life Henri, comte de Chambord, who, as the grandson of Charles X, had refused to abandon the fleur-de-lys and the white flag. Thus, Henri&apos;s own short-sightedness in this regard jeopardized the alliance between Legitimists (Bourbons) and Orleanists. Therefore, the monarchist cause remained divided did not present as strong a threat to the Third Republic as might have been the case had they been unified. Because of this division many remaining Orleanists rallied themselves to the Republic, behind Adolphe [ fra Thiers ]. The vast majority of the Legitimists abandoned the political arena or became marginalised. Still they remained a potent threat of trouble for the young Third Republic, especially while Henri Count of Chabord lived. When he died on 24 August 1883, the Third Republic had a large threat to its existence removed. Marshal MacMahon&apos;s successor as President of the Republic on 30 January 1879 was Jules Grevy. In January 1886, Georges Boulanger became Minister of War. Georges Clemanceau was instrumental in obtaining this appointment for Boulanger. This was the start of the Boulanger era, and was the start of another time of threats. [ Arthur Augustus Tilley Modern France: A Companion to French Studies 1967 CUP Archive 170 GGKEY:KFSQL2KCR5A ] Following the death of Henri Count of Chabord, the Legitimist (Bourbon) party was limited within the political arena within France. Some of them founded Action Française in 1898, during the Dreyfus Affair; it became an influential movement throughout the 1930s, in particular among the conservative Catholic intellectuals. The initial republic was in effect led by pro-royalists, but republicans (the &quot; Radicals &quot; ) and Bonapartists scrambled for power. The period from 1879–1899 saw power come into the hands of moderate republicans and former &quot; radicals &quot; (around Léon Gambetta ); these were called the &quot; Opportunists &quot;. The newly found Republican control of the Republic allowed the vote of the 1881 and 1882 Jules Ferry laws on a free, mandatory and laic public education. The moderates however became deeply divided over the Dreyfus Affair, and this allowed the Radicals eventually to gain power from 1899 until World War I. During this period, crises like the potential &quot; Boulangist &quot; coup d&apos;état in 1889, showed the fragility of the republic. The Radicals&apos; policies on education (suppression of local languages, compulsory education), mandatory military service, and control of the working classes eliminated internal dissent and regionalisms. Their participation in the Scramble for Africa and in the acquiring of overseas possessions (such as French Indochina ) created myths of French greatness. Both of these processes transformed a country of regionalisms into a modern nation state. Conflicts between the Chinese Emperor and the French Republic over Indochina climaxed during the Sino-French War. Admiral Courbet destroyed the Chinese fleet anchored at Foochow. The treaty ending the war, put France in a protectorate over northern and central Vietnam, which it divided into Tonkin and Annam. { Frederic Wakeman, Jr., The Fall of Imperial China (Free Press: New York, 1975) pp. 189–191. } In an effort to isolate Germany, France went to great pains to woo Russia and the United Kingdom to its side, first by means of the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894, the 1904 Entente Cordiale with the U.K, and finally, with the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907 which became the Triple Entente and eventually led Russia and the UK to enter World War I as Allies. France still had interests in Asia and looked for alliances and found in Japan a possible ally. During his visit to France, Iwakura Tomomi asked for French assistance in reforming Japan. French military missions were sent to Japan in 1872–1880, in 1884–1889 and the last one much later in 1918–1919 to help modernize the Japanese army. Distrust of Germany, faith in the army and native French anti-semitism combined to make the Dreyfus Affair (the unjust trial and condemnation of a Jewish military officer for treason) a political scandal of the utmost gravity. The nation was divided between &quot; dreyfusards &quot; and &quot; anti-dreyfusards &quot;, and far-right Catholic agitators inflamed the situation even when proofs of Dreyfus&apos; innocence came to light. The writer Emile Zola published an impassioned editorial on the injustice, and was himself condemned by the government for libel. Once Dreyfus was finally pardoned, the progressive legislature enacted the 1905 laws on laïcité, which created a complete separation of church and state and stripped churches of most of their property rights. Eiffel Tower under construction in July 1888. The period at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century is often termed the belle époque. Although associated with cultural innovations and popular amusements (cabaret, can-can, the cinema, new art forms such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau ), France was nevertheless a nation divided internally on notions of religion, class, regionalisms and money, and on the international front France came repeatedly to the brink of war with the other imperial powers, including Great Britain (the Fashoda Incident ). World War I was inevitable, but its human and financial costs would be catastrophic for the French. In 1889 the Exposition Universelle took place in Paris, and the Eiffel Tower was built as a temporary gate to the fair. Meant to last only a few decades, the tower was never removed and became France&apos;s most iconic landmark. [ Lucien Hervé Barry Bergdoll The Eiffel Tower http://books.google.com/books?id%3DXJvlC5e8Hb8C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA16 2003 Princeton Architectural Press 16 ] [ Since 1914 ] [ France in the twentieth century ] [ World War I ] [ World War I ] [ World War I casualties ] A French bayonet charge in World War I Preoccupied with internal problems, France played little attention to foreign policy in the 1911-14 period, although it did extend military service to three years from two over strong Socialist objections in 1913. The rapidly escalating Balkan crisis of 1914 caught France unawares, and it played only a small role in the coming of World War I. The Serbian crisis triggered a complex set of formal and secret military alliances between European states, causing most of the continent, including France, to be drawn into war within a few short weeks. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in late July, triggering Russian mobilization. On 1 August both Germany and France ordered mobilization. Germany was much better prepared militarily than any of the other countries involved, including France. Later on that day the German Empire, as an ally of Austria, declared war on Russia. France was allied with Russia and so was ready to commit to war against the German Empire. Germany on August 3 declared war on France, going through Belgium. Britain entered the war on 4 August, and started sending in troops on 7 August. { Verdun. &quot; &apos;&apos; } { They shall not pass &quot; &apos;&apos; is a phrase which for all time will be associated with the heroic defense of Verdun. } Germany&apos;s plan was to defeat the French quickly. They captured Brussels by 20 August and soon had captured a large portion of northern France. The original plan was to continue southwest and attack Paris from the west. By early September they were within 40 miles of Paris, and the French government had relocated to Bordeaux. The Allies finally stopped the advance northeast of Paris at the Marne River. [ Holger H. Herwig The Marne, 1914: The Opening of World War I and the Battle That Changed the World http://books.google.com/books?id%3DuIYgL6NKyMwC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA40 2011 Random House 266–306 ] The war now became a stalemate--the famous &quot; Western Front &quot; was fought largely in France and characterized by very little movement despite extremely large and violent battles, often with new and more destructive military technology. Famous battles in France include First Battle of the Marne, Battle of Verdun, Battle of the Somme and the Second Battle of the Marne. On the Western Front the small improvised trenches of the first few months rapidly grew deeper and more complex, gradually becoming vast areas of interlocking defensive works. The land war quickly became dominated by the muddy, bloody stalemate of Trench warfare, a form of war in which both opposing armies had static lines of defense. The war of movement quickly turned into a war of position. Attack followed others counterattack after counterattack. Neither side advanced much, but both sides suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. German and Allied armies produced essentially a matched pair of trench lines from the Swiss border in the south to the North Sea coast of Belgium. Trench warfare prevailed on the Western Front from September 1914 until March 1918. The space between the opposing trenches was referred to as &quot; no man&apos;s land &quot; (for its lethal uncrossability) and varied in width depending on the battlefield. On the Western Front it was typically between 100 and 300 yards (90–275 m), though sometimes much less. The common infantry soldier had four weapons to use in the trenches: the rifle, bayonet, shotgun, and hand grenade, but the only defense against machine guns and artillery was to stay low low in the trenches. [ G. D. Sheffield War on the Western Front http://books.google.com/books?id%3D2tZK2eEqM_gC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA194 2007 Osprey Publishing passim ] Britain introduced the first tanks to the war, while Renault enhanced the concept by adding a turret. The use in large quantity of these light tanks by Jean-Baptiste Estienne can be considered a decisive evolution in World War I&apos;s strategies. A French woman returns when the Germans retreat from her district and finds her home in ruins. When Russia exited the war in 1917 due to revolution, the Central Powers controlled all of the Balkans and could now shift military efforts to the Western Front. The U.S. had entered the war also in 1917, so the Central Powers hoped this could be achieved mostly prior to America&apos;s delivery of military support. In March 1918 Germany launched the last major offensive on the Western Front. By May Germany had reached the Marne again, as in September 1914, and was again close to Paris. In Second Battle of the Marne, however, the Allies were able to defend and then shift to offense due in part to the fatigue of the Germans and the arrival of more Americans. The Germans, out of reinforcements, were overwhelmed day after day and the high command saw it was hopeless. Austria and Turkey collapsed, the Kaiser&apos;s government fell, and Germany signed a surrender—the &quot; Armistice &quot; -- that ended the fighting on November 11, 1918. The war was fought in large part on French soil, with 1.4  million French dead including civilians, and four times as many military casualties. [ Peace terms ] { David Lloyd George, } { Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, } { Georges Clemenceau and } { Woodrow Wilson in Versailles } Peace terms were imposed by the Big Four —Clemenceau demanded the harshest terms and won most of them in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Germany was forced to admit its guilt for starting the war, and was permanently weakened militarily. France regained Alsace-Lorraine. Germany had to pay huge sums war reparations to the Allies (who in turn had large loans from the U.S. to pay off). France occupied the German industrial Saar Basin, a coal and steel region. The German African colonies put under League of Nations mandates, and were adminsitered by France and other victors. From the remains of the Ottoman Empire, France acquired the Mandate of Syria and the Mandate of Lebanon. [ Patrick O. Cohrs The Unfinished Peace After World War I: America, Britain And the Stabilisation of Europe, 1919-1932 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DnOWP-VD8k9cC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA50 2006 Cambridge U.P. 50 ] Ferdinand Foch wanted a peace that would never allow Germany to be a threat to France again. After the peace was signed he said, This is not a peace. It is an armistice for 20 years. [ Ruth Beatrice Henig Versailles and After, 1919-1933 http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dgjwd2ZFT2OoC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA52 1995 Psychology Press 52 ] [ Interwar years ] Foch supported Poland in the Greater Poland Uprising and in the Polish-Soviet War and France also joined Spain during the Rif War. From 1925 until his death in 1932, Aristide Briand, as prime minister during five short intervals, directed French foreign policy, using his diplomatic skills and sense of timing to forge friendly relations with Weimar Germany as the basis of a genuine peace within the framework of the League of Nations. He realized France could neither contain Germany by itself—it was much larger—nor secure effective support from Britain or the League. { Eugen Weber, The Hollow Years: France in the 1930s (1996) p 125 } The French economy was in the doldrums during the worldwide Great Depression after 1929. Leon Blum, leading the Popular Front brought together Socialists and Communists to become Prime Minister from 1936 to 1937; he was the first Jew to lead France. During the Spanish Civil War he did not support the Spanish Republicans because of the French internal political context of complex alliances and risk of war with Germany and Italy. In the 1920s, France established an elaborate system of border defences (the Maginot Line ), designed to fight off any German attack. The Maginot line did not extend into Belgium, where Germany attacked in 1940. Military alliances were signed with weak powers called the &quot; Little Entente &quot;. Appeasement of Germany, in cooperation with Britain, was the policy after 1936, as France sought peace, even in the face of Hitler &apos;s violations of the Versailles treaty and his escalating demands. Édouard Daladier refused to go to war against Germany and Italy without British support as Neville Chamberlain wanted to save peace at Munich in 1938.

The } { Wehrmacht bypassed the } { Maginot Line by marching through the Ardennes forest. A second German force was sent into Belgium and the Netherlands to act as a diversion to this main thrust. In six weeks of savage fighting the French lost 90,000 men. Joel Blatt (ed), The French Defeat of 1940 (Oxford, 1998) } { Many civilians sought refuge by taking to the roads of France: some two million refugees from Belgium and Holland were joined by between eight and ten million French civilians, representing a quarter of the French population, all heading south and west. This movement may well have been the largest single movement of civilians in history prior to 1947. } Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June 1940, and the French leaders surrendered on 24 June 1940 after the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from Dunkirk. Nazi Germany occupied three fifths of France&apos;s territory, leaving the rest in the southeast to the new Vichy government. This regime sought to collaborate with Germany. It was established on 10 July 1940. The Vichy Regime was led by Philippe Pétain, the aging war hero of First World War. It was originally intended to be a temporary, care-taker regime, to supervise French administration before the soon-expected defeat of Britain. Instead, it lasted four years. It was unique among the various collaborating regimes of wartime Europe in that it was established constitutionally, through the French parliament. However, Charles de Gaulle declared himself on Radio Londres the head of a rival government in exile, gathering the Free French Forces around him, finding support in some French colonies and recognition from Britain and the USA. The Vichy regime adopted violent, repressive anti-semitic policies on its own initiative, without direction from Nazi Germany, as has been highlighted by the historian Robert Paxton. { Robert O. Paxton, Vichy France, Old Guard and New Order, New York, 1972 } During the German occupation 76,000 Jews would be deported, often with the help of the Vichy French authorities, and murdered in the Nazis&apos; extermination camp s. After the Attack on Mers-el-Kébir in 1940, where the British fleet destroyed a large part of the French navy, still under command of Vichy France, that killed about 1,100 sailors, there was nationwide indignation and a feeling of distrust in the French forces, leading to the events of the Battle of Dakar. Eventually, several important French ships such as the Richelieu and the Surcouf joined the Free French Forces. On the Eastern Front the USSR was lacking pilots and several French pilots joined the Soviet Union and fought the Luftwaffe in the Normandie-Niemen squadron. Within France proper, very few people organized themselves against the German Occupation in the summer of 1940. However, their numbers grew as the Vichy regime resorted to more strident policies in order to fulfill the enormous demands of the Nazis and the eventual decline of Nazi Germany became more obvious. Isolated opposers eventually formed a real movement: the Resistance. { H. R. Kedward, In Search of the Maquis (Oxford, 1993) } The most famous figure of the French resistance was Jean Moulin, sent in France by De Gaulle in order to link all resistance movements. He was tortured by Klaus Barbie (the &quot; butcher of Lyon &quot; ). Increasing repression culminated in the complete destruction and extermination of the village of Oradour-sur-Glane, at the height of the Battle of Normandy. There were also Frenchmen who joined the SS, they were known as the Charlemagne Division; knowing they would not survive should Germany be defeated, they were among the last ones to surrender at Berlin. { D-Day, 1944 } Whilst recognising this extensive collaboration, the British historian Simon Kitson has shown that the Vichy regime engaged in an extensive programme of arresting German intelligence agents in the unoccupied zone. { Simon Kitson, Vichy et la Chasse aux Espions Nazis, Paris, Autrement, 2005; Simon Kitson, The Hunt for Nazi Spies, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2007 } Around 2000 were arrested and some were subsequently executed. Vichy&apos;s purpose in this respect was to preserve its sovereignty. In November 1942 Vichy France was finally occupied by German forces, because the war in North Africa was coming to an end; the Germans foresaw a threat in southern Europe by the allied forces. On 6 June 1944 the Allies landed in Normandy while on 15 August they landed in Provence (including the 260,000 men of the French army B). General Leclerc freed Paris between 19–25 August 1944, and Strasbourg. He later, along with the battleship Richelieu, represented France at Tokyo during the Japanese surrender. The Vichy regime fled to Germany. The 1st [ March 2010 ] French army recruited French Forces of the Interior fighters to continue the war until the final defeat of Germany. This army numbered 300,000 men by September 1944 and 370,000 by spring in 1945 (the 2nd DB wasn&apos;t in it). France was liberated by allied forces in 1944 [ March 2010 ]. The day Germany surrendered French forces were involved in the Sétif massacre in Algeria. [ November 2011 ] [ Cold War ] [ Provisional Government of the French Republic French Fourth Republic French Fifth Republic ] After liberation a provisional government of the Republic was established led by General Charles de Gaulle, a new constitution (13 October 1946) established the Fourth Republic under a parliamentary form of government controlled by a series of coalitions. During the following 16 years the French Colonial Empire would disintegrate. Israel was established in 1948, and France was one of the fiercest supporters of the Jewish state, supplying it with extensive weaponry it used during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The French Republic needed an alliance with Israel to secure the Suez Canal from potential threats in a context of decolonisation. In Indochina the French government was facing the Viet Minh communist rebels and lost its Indochinese colonies during the First Indochina War in 1954 after the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Vietnam was divided in two states while Cambodia and Laos were made independent. France left Indochina only to be replaced there by the United States, which would soon be engaged in the long Vietnam War. In 1956 another crisis struck French colonies, this time in Egypt. The Suez Canal, having been built by the French government, belonged to the French Republic and was operated by the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez. Great Britain had bought the Egyptian share from Isma&apos;il Pasha and was the second largest owner of the canal before the crisis. The Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the canal despite French and British opposition; he estimated a European answer was most unlikely to happen. Great Britain and France attacked Egypt and built an alliance with Israel against Nasser. Israel attacked from the east, Britain from Cyprus and France from Algeria. Egypt, the most powerful Arab state of the time, was defeated in a mere few days. The Suez crisis caused an outcry of indignation in the entire Arab world and Saudi Arabia set an embargo on oil on France and Britain. The US President Dwight D. Eisenhower forced a ceasefire when he threatened to sell all American shares of British Pounds and to crash the British economy. The British forces were retired from the conflict and Israel, having seized interests in the Sinai region, withdrew soon leaving France alone in Egypt. Under stronger political pressures the French government ultimately evacuated its troops from Suez. This was a major political defeat for France and the American threats during the war were received with indignation by the French popular opinion. This led directly, and was used as a point, to the French withdrawal from the integrated military command of NATO in 1966. Another consequence of this was the French loss of geopolitical interests in the region; this meant an alliance with Israel was no longer of any use for French diplomacy. General de Gaulle was elected president in 1958 and made the French Force de Frappe, the nuclear power, a priority of the French Defence. France then adopted the dissuasion du faible au fort doctrine which meant a Soviet attack on France would only bring total destruction to both sides. [ Within ten years, we shall have the means to kill 80 million Russians. I truly believe that one does not light-heartedly attack people who are able to kill 80  million Russians, even if one can kill 800  million French, that is if there were 800  million French. ] The May 1958 seizure of power in Algiers by French army units and French settlers opposed to concessions in the face of Arab nationalist insurrection led to the fall of the French government and a presidential invitation to de Gaulle to form an emergency government to forestall the threat of civil war. The new constitution of the French Fifth Republic, introduced on 5 October 1958, gave greater powers to the presidency. Algeria became independent in 1962. In May 1968 students revolted, with a variety of demands including educational, labor and governmental reforms, sexual and artistic freedom, and the end of the Vietnam War. The student protest in unruly movements quickly joined with labor, and mass strikes erupted. De Gaulle responded by calling a legislative election for 23 June, in which his UDR party increased their vote, and the protests faded away during the summer. [ Post Cold War ] { Treaty of Nice } After the fall of the USSR and the end of the Cold War potential menaces to mainland France appeared considerably reduced. France began reducing its nuclear capacities and conscription was abolished in 2001. In 1990 France, led by François Mitterrand, joined the short lived Gulf War against Iraq, the French participation to this war would be called the Opération Daguet. However, despite the end of the cold war and the fact future conflicts would be fought away from home, there were still menaces against mainland France in the form of terrorism. In 1994 Air France Flight 8969 was hijacked by Islamic terrorists with the suspected intent to crash the plane over Paris. The hijacking was a failure for the terrorist group, known as the GIA after an intervention from the GIGN in Marseille, where the plane was grounded. More terrorist attacks would happen and these culminated into the 1995 Paris Metro bombing. Important leaders of the GIA in France fell afterward: Khaled Kelkal was killed in Lyon by the EPIGN and Rachid Ramda was arrested in London although it took ten years for the French justice to have him extradited. Jacques Chirac assumed office as president on 17 May 1995, after a campaign focused on the need to combat France&apos;s stubbornly high unemployment rate. While France continues to revere its rich history and independence, French leaders increasingly tie the future of France to the continued development of the European Union. In 1992 France ratified the Maastricht Treaty establishing the European Union. In 1999, the Euro was introduced to replace the French franc. Beyond membership in the European Union, France is also involved in many joint European projects such as Airbus, the Galileo positioning system and the Eurocorps. The French have stood among the strongest supporters of NATO and EU policy in the Balkans to prevent genocide in Yugoslavia. French troops joined the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. France has also been actively involved against international terrorism. In 2002 Alliance Base, an international Counterterrorist Intelligence Center, was secretly established in Paris. The same year France contributed to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, but it strongly rejected the 2003 invasion of Iraq, even threatening to veto in central coners in the US proposed resolution. Jacques Chirac was reelected in 2002, mainly because his socialist rival Lionel Jospin was defeated by the extreme right wing candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen. France was struck by a long period of civil unrest in 2005 after the death of two teenagers. At the end of his second term Jacques Chirac chose not to run again at the age of 74. The cabinet minister and rival Nicolas Sarkozy was elected and took office on 16 May 2007. The problem of high unemployment has yet to be resolved. In 2008, France was one of the first states to recognise Kosovo as an independent nation.

Preceding him, Elie Carafoli was a pioneering contributor to the field of aerodynamics in the world. Victor Babeș discovered more than 50 germs and a cure for a disease named after him, babesiosis; biologist Nicolae Paulescu discovered insulin. Another biologist, Emil Palade, received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology. George Constantinescu created the theory of sonics, while Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesize amphetamine and also invented the modern method of refining crude oil. Costin Nenițescu found new methods for the synthesis of pirilium salts, of carbene s, tryptamine, serotonin, two new syntheses for the indole nucleus, and a new method of polymerisation of ethylene. Several mathematicians distinguished themselves as well, among them: Gheorghe Țițeica, Spiru Haret, Grigore Moisil, Miron Nicolescu, Nicolae Popescu and Ștefan Odobleja; the latter is also regarded as the ideological father behind cybernetics. Notable physicists and inventors also include: Horia Hulubei in atomic physics, Șerban Țițeica in theoretical physics, Mihai Gavrilă specialized in quantum theory and discoverer of the atomic dichotomy phenomenon, Alexandru Proca (known for the first meson theory of nuclear forces and Proca&apos;s equations of the vectorial mesonic field), Ștefan Procopiu known for the first theory of the magnetic moment of the electron in 1911 (now known as the Bohr-Procopiu magneton ), Theodor V. Ionescu, the inventor of a multiple-cavity magnetron (1935), a hydrogen maser in 1947, 3D imaging for cinema/television in 1924 and hot deuterium plasma studies for controlled nuclear fusion, Ionel Solomon known for the nuclear magnetic resonance theory in solids, Solomon equations [ http://chem.iitm.ac.in/professordetails/chandrakumar/msc_lectures/MSc_Lecture_Notes/The_Solomon_equations.pdf The Solomon equations PDF 2011-08-29 ] [ http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v99/i2/p559_1 Solomon Equations and NOE Prola.aps.org 1955-03-29 2011-08-29 ] and photovoltaic devices, Petrache Poenaru, Nicolae Teclu and Victor Toma, with the latter known for the invention and construction of the first Romanian computer, the CIFA-1 in 1955. { Victor Toma- &quot; Tatăl calculatoarelor din țările socialiste &quot;.

Closely related to human existence, the folkloric costume reflected over time, as reflected nowadays, mentality and artistic conception of the people. The folkloric costume has been developed with history, being a genuine expression of coherent tradition s throughout centuries. Distinct clothing ornamentation, traditional methods used for sewing and tailoring the pieces of clothing, and wide variety of costumes from one region to another customize the defining spirit of the Romanian people. For women, one of the most important parts of the celebration costume is a kerchief called maramă. A maramă is made from a special fabric called borangic, which resembles silk, so the texture of the material is really nice and soft. An important aspect is its transparency, given by the weaver in which it&apos;s made. The borangic is obtained from silkworms&apos; cocoons. Every woman grows the silkworms in her own yard, feeding them with mullberry leaves. After approximately 6 weeks, the worms would hide in their cocoons and the person who&apos;s in charge of them should move the cocoons into the sun so the worms die and the silk filament can be extracted. Once all the filaments are extracted, they&apos;re put into a weaver and one woman starts making the maramă. { http://www.unibuc.ro/uploads_ro/48384/1328/CIVILIZATIA_TRADITIONALA.pdf } Also, the folklore of Romania is defined by its mythology, branch of folk literature that integrates a variety of ancestral habits, tale s, fable s and ballad s, whose authors are anonymous.

Doina, characteristic only Romanian literary folklore, represents the lyric creation that Romanian expresses the most varied and complex range of feelings, strongly rooted in his spiritual structure.

To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself. &quot; &quot; Anarchism and the State &quot; in Individual Liberty } Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict. From there it expanded through Europe and the United States. Benjamin R. Tucker, a famous 19th century individualist anarchist, held that &quot; if the individual has the right to govern himself, all external government is tyranny. &quot; [ Benjamin R.

Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX. &quot; &quot; Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923-1938) &quot; } Josiah Warren ( &quot; sovereignty of the individual &quot; ), Lysander Spooner ( &quot; natural law &quot; ), Pierre Joseph Proudhon ( mutualism ), Anselme Bellegarrigue, { George Woodcock, Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 } Herbert Spencer ( &quot; law of equal liberty &quot; ) { Freeden, Micheal. Ideologies and Political Theory: A Conceptual Approach. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-829414-X. pp. 313-314 } and Max Stirner ( egoism ). [ max-stirner Max Stirner David Leopold 2006-08-04 ] Individualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common. These are: 1. The concentration on the individual and his/her will in preference to any construction such as morality, ideology, social custom, religion, metaphysics, ideas or the will of others. { &quot; En la vida de todo único, todo vínculo, independientemente de la forma en que éste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condición de persona libre. Ello supone dos consecuencias; la libertad se mantendrá al margen de toda categoría moral. Este último concepto quedará al margen del vocabulario estirneriano, puesto que tanto ética como moral serán dos conceptos absolutos que, como tales, no pueden situarse por encima de la voluntad individual. La libertad se vive siempre al margen de cualquier condicionamiento material o espiritual, &quot; más allá del bien y del mal &quot; como enunciará Nietzsche en una de sus principales obras. Las creencias colectivas, los prejuicios compartidos, los convencionalismos sociales serán, pues, objeto de destrucción. &quot; &quot; Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923-1938) &quot; } { &quot; Stirner himself, however, has no truck with &quot; higher beings. &quot; Indeed, with the aim of concerning himself purely with his own interests, he attacks all &quot; higher beings, &quot; regarding them as a variety of what he calls &quot; spooks, &quot; or ideas to which individuals sacrifice themselves and by which they are dominated. First amongst these is the abstraction &quot; Man &quot;, into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, &quot; liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts &apos;Man&apos; to the same extent as any other religion does to God... it sets me beneath Man. &quot; Indeed, he &quot; who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook. &quot; [p. 176 and p.79] Among the many &quot; spooks &quot; Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself. We will discuss Stirner&apos;s critique of capitalism before moving onto his vision of an egoist society and how it relates to social anarchism. &quot; &quot; G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner &quot; in [[An Anarchist FAQ ]] } 2. The rejection of or reservations about the idea of revolution, seeing it as a time of mass uprising which could bring about new hierarchies. Instead they favor more evolutionary methods of bringing about anarchy through alternative experiences and experiments and education which could be brought about today. { &quot; The first is in regard to the means of action in the here and now (and so the manner in which anarchy will come about). Individualists generally prefer education and the creation of alternative institutions, such as mutual banks, unions, communes, etc.. Such activity, they argue, will ensure that present society will gradually develop out of government into an anarchist one. They are primarily evolutionists, not revolutionists, and dislike social anarchists&apos; use of direct action to create revolutionary situations. &quot; &quot; A.3.1 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists? &quot; in [[An Anarchist FAQ ]] } { &quot; Toda revolución, pues, hecha en nombre de principios abstractos como igualdad, fraternidad, libertad o humanidad, persigue el mismo fin; anular la voluntad y soberanía del individuo, para así poderlo dominar. &quot; La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923-1938) } This is also because it is not seen as desirable for individuals to wait for revolution to start experiencing alternative experiences outside what is offered in the current social system. { &quot; The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s... and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War... were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital. The illegalist comrades were tired of waiting for the revolution. The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ( &quot; propaganda by the deed &quot; ) and the anarchist burglars ( &quot; individual reappropriation &quot; ) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary, invitations to revolt. &quot; THE &quot; ILLEGALISTS &quot; by Doug Imrie } 3. The view that relationships with other persons or things can be in one&apos;s own interest only and can be as transitory and without compromises as desired since in individualist anarchism sacrifice is usually rejected. In this way, Max Stirner recommended associations of egoists. { Finalmente, y este es un tema poco resuelto por el filósofo bávaro, resulta evidente que, a pesar de todo culto a la soberanía individual, es necesario y deseable que los individuos cooperen. Pero el peligro de la asociación conlleva la reproducción, an escala diferente, de una sociedad, y es evidente que en este contexto, los individuos deban renunciar a buena parte de su soberanía. Stirner propone &quot; uniones de egoístas &quot;, formadas por individuos libres que pueden unirse episódicamente para colaborar, pero evitando la estabilidad o la permanencia. &quot; La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923-1938) } &quot; The unions Stirner desires would be based on free agreement, being spontaneous and voluntary associations drawn together out of the mutual interests of those involved, who would &quot; care best for their welfare if they unite with others. &quot; [p.  309] The unions, unlike the state, exist to ensure what Stirner calls &quot; intercourse, &quot; or &quot; union &quot; between individuals. To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples. [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p.  25] These illustrate the kinds of relationships that maximise an individual&apos;s self-enjoyment, pleasure, freedom, and individuality, as well as ensuring that those involved sacrifice nothing while belonging to them. Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals. As Stirner puts it, &quot; intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals. &quot; [p.  218] Its aim is &quot; pleasure &quot; and &quot; self-enjoyment. &quot; Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are: &quot; But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others. That would be a man bereft of innumerable pleasures, a wretched character... would he not be a wretched egoist, rather than a genuine Egoist?... The person who loves a human being is, by virtue of that love, a wealthier man that someone else who loves no one. &quot; [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p. 23] &quot; What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists? Individual experience and exploration therefore is emphasized. The egoist form of individualist anarchism, derived from the philosophy of Max Stirner, supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases – taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules. [ Miller David The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought 1987 Blackwell Publishing 11 0631227814 ] To Stirner, rights were spooks in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but &quot; the individuals are its reality &quot; – he supported property by force of might rather than moral right. { &quot; What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as I entitle, that is, empower myself to take… &quot; From } { The Ego and Its Own, quoted in } [ Ossar Michael 1980 Anarchism in the Dramas of Ernst Toller State University of New York Press 27 0873953932 ] Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw &quot; associations of egoists &quot; drawn together by respect for each other&apos;s ruthlessness. [ George Woodcock Woodcock George 2004 Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements Broadview Press 20 0140206221 ] For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, american individualist anarchism &quot; stresses the isolation of the individual—his right to his own tools, his mind, his body, and to the products of his labor. To the artist who embraces this philosophy it is &quot; aesthetic &quot; anarchism, to the reformer, ethical anarchism, to the independent mechanic, economic anarchism. The former is concerned with philosophy, the latter with practical demonstration. The economic anarchist is concerned with constructing a society on the basis of anarchism. Economically he sees no harm whatever in the private possession of what the individual produces by his own labor, but only so much and no more. The aesthetic and ethical type found expression in the transcendentalism, humanitarianism, and romanticism of the first part of the nineteenth century, the economic type in the pioneer life of the West during the same period, but more favorably after the Civil War. &quot; { &apos;&apos;NATIVE AMERICAN ANARCHISM A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism&apos;&apos; by Eunice Minette Schuster } It is for this reason that it has been suggested that in order to understand American individualist anarchism one must take into account &quot; the social context of their ideas, namely the transformation of America from a pre-capitalist to a capitalist society...the non-capitalist nature of the early U.S. can be seen from the early dominance of self-employment (artisan and peasant production). At the beginning of the 19th century, around 80% of the working (non-slave) male population were self-employed. The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs. &quot; and so &quot; Individualist anarchism is clearly a form of artisan al socialism... while communist anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism. &quot; { &quot; G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism? &quot; in &apos;&apos;[[An Anarchist FAQ ]&apos;&apos;] } In European individualist anarchism a different social context helped the rise of European individualist illegalism and as such &quot; The illegalists were proletarians who had nothing to sell but their labour power, and nothing to discard but their dignity; if they disdained waged-work, it was because of its compulsive nature. If they turned to illegality it was due to the fact that honest toil only benefited the employers and often entailed a complete loss of dignity, while any complaints resulted in the sack; to avoid starvation through lack of work it was necessary to beg or steal, and to avoid conscription into the army many of them had to go on the run. &quot; { Richard Parry. &apos;&apos;The Bonnot Gang: The Story of the French Illegalists&apos;&apos; } And so a European tendency of individualist anarchism advocated violent individual acts of individual reclamation, propaganda by the deed and criticism of organization. Such individualist anarchist tendencies include French illegalism { The &quot; Illegalists &quot;, by Doug Imrie (published by } { Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed ) } { Parry, Richard. The Bonnot Gang. Rebel Press, 1987. p. 15 } and Italian anti-organizational insurrectionarism. { &quot; Anarchist historian } { George Woodcock reports the incident in which the important Italian } { social anarchist } { Errico Malatesta became involved &quot; in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of } { Paterson, who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant. &quot; Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 } Bookchin reports that at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th &quot; it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity -- and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy. &quot;. { [[Murray Bookchin ]. } { Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm ] } Another important tendency within individualist anarchist currents emphasizes individual subjective exploration and defiance of social conventions. Individualist anarchist philosophy attracted &quot; amongst artists, intellectuals and the well-read, urban middle classes in general. &quot; As such Murray Bookchin describes a lot of individualist anarchism as people who &quot; expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siecle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a bohemian lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom (&apos;free love&apos;) and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing. &quot;. { &quot; 2. Individualist Anarchism and Reaction &quot; in Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism - An Unbridgeable Chasm } In this way free love currents and other radical lifestyles such as naturism had popularity among individualist anarchists. For Catalan historian Xavier Diez Spanish individualist anarchism &quot; under its iconoclastic, antiintelectual, antitheist run, which goes against all sacralized ideas or values it entailed, a philosophy of life which could be considered a reaction against the sacred gods of capitalist society. Against the idea of nation, it opposed its internationalism. Against the exaltation of authority embodied in the military intitution, it opposed its antimilitarism. Against the concept of industrial civilization, it opposed its naturist vision &quot;. { Xavier Diez. L&apos;anarquisme Individualista a Espanya 1923-1938 } In regards to economic questions, there are diverse positions. There are adherents to mutualism (Proudhon, Emile Armand, early Benjamin Tucker ), egoist ic disrespect for &quot; ghosts &quot; such as private property and markets (Stirner, John Henry Mackay, Lev Chernyi, later Tucker), and adherents to anarcho-communism ( Albert Libertad, illegalism, Renzo Novatore ). { &quot; revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy. To create new ethical values. To create new aesthetic values. To communalize material wealth. To individualize spiritual wealth. &quot; &apos;&apos;Towards the creative nothing&apos;&apos; by } { Renzo Novatore } Anarchist historian George Woodcock finds a tendency in individualist anarchism of a &quot; distrust (of) all co-operation beyond the barest minimum for an ascetic life &quot;. { George Woodcock.

Broadview Press. p. 20 } and philosophical anarchist who was influenced by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, { &quot; Anarchism &quot;, } { Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2006 (UK version) } and developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought. Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, &quot; the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work. &quot; { Peter Kropotkin, &quot; Anarchism &quot;, &apos;&apos; } { Encyclopædia Britannica, 1910 } { Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to } { Edmund Burke &apos;s } { A Vindication of Natural Society. &quot; Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke&apos;s Vindication of Natural Society; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence… &quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 } { Political Justice by William Godwin. } Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated. { &quot; Godwin, William &quot;. (2006). In Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia. Retrieved December 7, 2006, from } { Encyclopædia Britannica Online. } Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us &quot; of more worth and importance&apos; than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore he does not believe in equal rights, but the person&apos;s life that should be favored that is most conducive to the general good. [ Paul McLaughlin Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism Ashgate Publishing, 2007 119 0754661962 ] Godwin opposed government because it infringes on the individual&apos;s right to &quot; private judgement &quot; to determine which actions most maximize utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual&apos;s judgement. This aspect of Godwin&apos;s philosophy, minus the utilitarianism, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner. [ Paul McLaughlin Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism Ashgate Publishing, 2007 123 0754661962 ] Godwin took individualism to the radical extent of opposing individuals performing together in orchestras, writing in Political Justice that &quot; everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil. &quot; The only apparent exception to this opposition to cooperation is the spontaneous association that may arise when a society is threatened by violent force. One reason he opposed cooperation is he believed it to interfere with an individual&apos;s ability to be benevolent for the greater good. Godwin opposes the idea of government, but wrote that a minimal state as a present &quot; necessary evil &quot; [ Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners Godwin William William Godwin 1796 G.G. and J. Robinson 2340417 1793 ] that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. He expressly opposed democracy, fearing oppression of the individual by the majority (though he believed it to be preferable to dictatorship ). { Political Justice &apos;&apos; } Godwin supported individual ownership of property, defining it as &quot; the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry. &quot; However, he also advocated that individuals give to each other their surplus property on the occasion that others have a need for it, without involving trade (e.g. gift economy ). Thus, while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened altruists. This was to be based on utilitarian principles; he said: &quot; Every man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated. &quot; However, benevolence was not to be enforced, being a matter of free individual &quot; private judgement. &quot; He did not advocate a community of goods or assert collective ownership as is embraced in communism, but his belief that individuals ought to share with those in need was influential on the later development of anarchist communism. Godwin&apos;s political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with any of the ideologies that claim his influence; writers of the Socialist Standard, organ of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, consider Godwin both an individualist and a communist; { &quot; William Godwin, Shelly and Communism &quot; by ALB, The Socialist Standard } anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard did not regard Godwin as being in the individualist camp at all, referring to him as the &quot; founder of communist anarchism &quot;; &lt; ref name=rothbard/burke &gt; Rothbard, Murray. &quot; Edmund Burke, Anarchist. &quot; &lt; /ref &gt; and historian Albert Weisbord considers him an individualist anarchist without reservation. [ Weisbord Albert Albert Weisbord The Conquest of Power 2008-08-05 1937 Covici-Friede New York 1019295 Libertarianism http://www.weisbord.org/conquest8.htm ] Some writers see a conflict between Godwin&apos;s advocacy of &quot; private judgement &quot; and utilitarianism, as he says that ethics requires that individuals give their surplus property to each other resulting in an egalitarian society, but, at the same time, he insists that all things be left to individual choice. Many of Godwin&apos;s views changed over time, as noted by Kropotkin. William Godwin &apos;s influenced &quot; the socialism of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren (1798-1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist. After New Harmony failed Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen&apos;s socialism had been predicated on Godwin&apos;s anarchism). &quot; { Peter Sabatini. &quot; Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy &quot; } [ Pierre-Joseph Proudhon ] { Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the first self-identified anarchist. } [ Pierre-Joseph Proudhon ] Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) was the first philosopher to label himself an &quot; anarchist. &quot; { &quot; Anarchism &quot;, } { BBC Radio 4 program, } { In Our Time, Thursday December 7, 2006.

Tucker. { Tucker, Benjamin R., &quot; On Picket Duty &quot;, Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881 –1908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Onlinepg. 1 } Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus, he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent, tax). He generally called the former &quot; possession &quot; and the latter &quot; property. &quot; For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land. Proudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce, and that monopolies on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market but without profit, which he called mutualism. It is Proudhon&apos;s philosophy that was explicitly rejected by Joseph Dejacque in the inception of anarchist-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that &quot; it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature. &quot; An individualist rather than anarchist communist, Proudhon said that &quot; communism...is the very denial of society in its foundation... &quot; { Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). ISBN 1-4264-0908-7 pp. 217 } and famously declared that &quot; property is theft ! &quot; in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land. After Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter&apos;s support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists, who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon, and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of collectivists like Mikhail Bakunin, while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals. [ Mutualism ] [ Mutualism (economic theory) ] Modern symbol of mutualism Mutualism is an anarchist school of thought which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. { Mutualist.org Introduction } Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration. { Miller, David. 1987. &quot; Mutualism. &quot; The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11 } Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value which holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying &quot; the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility &quot;. { Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 15. } Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert. { Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 &amp; 22. Carson, Kevin, 2004, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, chapter 2 (after Meek &amp; Oppenheimer). } Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments, and rent, as they believe these individuals are not labouring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital. { Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 19. Carson, Kevin, 2004, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb &amp; Oppenheimer). } Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: &quot;... I never meant to... forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all. &quot; { Solution of the Social Problem, 1848-49. } { What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government by Pierre Joseph Proudhon &apos;&apos; by } { Pierre Joseph Proudhon } { Insofar } as they ensure the workers right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support market s and private property in the product of labor. However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called &quot; possession. &quot; ) { Swartz, Clarence Lee. What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent } Proudhon&apos;s Mutualism supports labor-owned cooperative firms and associations { Hymans, E., Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, pp. 190-1, Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements, Broadview Press, 2004, pp. 110 &amp; 112 } for &quot; we need not hesitate, for we have no choice... it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers... because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two... castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society &quot; and so &quot; it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism. &quot; { General Idea of the Revolution, Pluto Press, pp. 215-216 and p. 277 } As for capital goods (man-made, non-land, &quot; means of production &quot; ), mutualist opinion differs on whether these should be commonly managed public assets or private property. Mutualists, following Proudhon, originally considered themselves to be libertarian socialists. However, &quot; some mutualists have abandoned the labor theory of value, and prefer to avoid the term &quot; socialist. &quot; But they still retain some cultural attitudes, for the most part, that set them off from the libertarian right. &quot; { A Mutualist FAQ: A.4. Are Mutualists Socialists? } Mutualists have distinguished themselves from state socialism, and don&apos;t advocate social control over the means of production. Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon, that &quot; though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, Proudhon aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few...by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost. &quot; { Tucker, Benjamin, State Socialism and Anarchism, State Socialism and Anarchism } [ Max Stirner ] [ Max Stirner ] { Max Stirner. Portrait by } { Friedrich Engels. } { Johann } Kaspar Schmidt (October 25, 1806 – June 26, 1856), better known as Max Stirner (the nom de plume he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, in German &apos;Stirn&apos;), was a German philosopher, who ranks as one of the literary fathers of nihilism, existentialism, post-modernism and anarchism, especially of individualist anarchism. Stirner&apos;s main work is The Ego and Its Own, also known as The Ego and His Own (Der Einzige und sein Eigentum in German, which translates literally as The Only One and his Property). This work was first published in 1844 in Leipzig, and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations. [ Egoism ] [ Egoist anarchism Philosophy of Max Stirner ] Max Stirner &apos;s philosophy, sometimes called &quot; egoism, &quot; is the most extreme [ David Goodway Goodway David Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow Liverpool University Press 2006 99 1846310261 ] form of individualist anarchism. Max Stirner was a Hegelian philosopher whose &quot; name appears with familiar regularity in historically oriented surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism. &quot; In 1844, his The Ego and Its Own (Der Einzige and sein Eigentum which may literally be translated as The Unique Individual and His Property) { Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177 } was published, which is considered to be &quot; a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism. &quot; Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the state but simply that they disregard the state when it conflicts with one&apos;s autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive to one&apos;s interests. { Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 190 } He says that the egoist rejects pursuit of devotion to &quot; a great idea, a good cause, a doctirine, a system, a lofty calling, &quot; saying that the egoist has no political calling but rather &quot; lives themselves out &quot; without regard to &quot; how well or ill humanity may fare thereby. &quot; { Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183 } Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is that individual&apos;s power to obtain what he desires. { The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176 } He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions —including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society —were mere spooks in the mind. Stirner wants to &quot; abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members. &quot; { Heider, Ulrike. Anarchism: Left, Right and Green, San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95-96 } Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw Unions of Egoists, non-systematic associations, which Stirner proposed in as a form of organization in place of the state. [ Thomas Paul Karl Marx and the Anarchists Routledge / Kegan Paul London 1985 0710206852 142 ] A Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties&apos; support through an act of will.

The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 191 } though it is claimed by egoist anarchists that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. [ Carlson Andrew Anarchism in Germany Scarecrow Press Metuchen 1972 0810804840 http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/carlson.html Philosophical Egoism: German Antecedents 2008-12-04 ] For Stirner, property simply comes about through might: &quot; Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. &quot; And, &quot; What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing. &quot; He says, &quot; I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property! &quot;. { Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own, p. 248 } His concept of &quot; egoistic property &quot; not only a lack of moral restraint on how own obtains and uses things, but includes other people as well. { Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194 } His embrace of egoism is in stark contrast to Godwin&apos;s altruism. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual. This position on property is much different from the native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism, which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labor { Weir, David. Anarchy &amp; Culture. University of Massachusetts Press. 1997. p. 146 } and trade. However, in 1886 Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner&apos;s egoism, with several others joining with him. This split the American individualists into fierce debate, &quot; with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. &quot; { McElroy, Wendy.

Russian Review, Vol. 26, No. 4. (Oct., 1967). p. 343 } This type of individualist anarchism inspired anarcho-feminist Emma Goldman Though Stirner&apos;s philosophy is individualist, it has influenced some libertarian communists and anarcho-communists. &quot; For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management &quot; discusses Stirner and speaks of a &quot; communist egoism, &quot; which is said to be a &quot; synthesis of individualism and collectivism, &quot; and says that &quot; greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society. &quot; { For Ourselves, The Right to Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything, 1974. } Forms of libertarian communism such as Situationism are influenced by Stirner. { see, for example, Christopher Gray, Leaving the Twentieth Century, p. 88. } Anarcho-communist Emma Goldman was influenced by both Stirner and Peter Kropotkin and blended their philosophies together in her own, as shown in books of hers such as Anarchism And Other Essays. { Emma Goldman, Anarchism and Other Essays, p. 50. } [ Early American individualist anarchism ] [ Josiah Warren ] [ Josiah Warren ] { Josiah Warren } Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, { Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) What do anarchists want from us?, } { Slate.com } and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published, { William Bailie, Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist — A Sociological Study, Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1906, p. 20 } an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type, and made his own printing plates. Warren was a follower of Robert Owen and joined Owen&apos;s community at New Harmony, Indiana. Josiah Warren termed the phrase &quot; Cost the limit of price, &quot; with &quot; cost &quot; here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item. { &quot; A watch has a cost and a value. The COST consists of the amount of labor bestowed on the mineral or natural wealth, in converting it into metals… &quot;. Warren, Josiah. Equitable Commerce } Therefore, &quot; [h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce. &quot;. He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental &quot; labor for labor store &quot; called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included &quot; Utopia &quot; and &quot; Modern Times. &quot; Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews &apos; The Science of Society, published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren&apos;s own theories. { Charles A. Madison. &quot; Anarchism in the United States &quot;. Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 6, No. 1. (Jan., 1945), pp. 53 } Catalan historian Xavier Diez report that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in European individualist anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as Emile Armand and the intentional communities started by them. { Xavier Diez. &apos;&apos;L&apos;ANARQUISME INDIVIDUALISTA A ESPANYA 1923-1938&apos;&apos; pg. 42 } [ Henry David Thoreau ] [ Henry David Thoreau ] { Henry David Thoreau } Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on green anarchism but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later naturist currents, simple living as a rejection of a materialist lifestyle and self-sufficiency were Thoreau&apos;s goals, and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. &quot; Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in John Zerzan. For George Woodcock this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century. &quot; The essay Civil Disobedience (Resistance to Civil Government) was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican-American War. The essay later influenced Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Martin Buber and Leo Tolstoy through its advocacy of nonviolent resistance. { RESISTING THE NATION STATE the pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard } It is also the main precedent for anarcho-pacifism. The American version of individualist anarchism has a strong emphasis on the non-aggression principle and individual sovereignty.

Free love particularly stressed women&apos;s rights since most sexual laws, such as those governing marriage and use of birth control, discriminated against women. The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer (1883–1907) edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker { Joanne E. Passet, &quot; Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism, &quot; in: Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, James Philip Danky and Wayne A.

Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love. Later John William Lloyd, a collaborator of Benjamin Tucker ´s periodical Liberty, published in 1931 a sex manual that he called The Karezza Method: Or Magnetation, the Art of Connubial Love. { http://www.reuniting.info/karezza_method_lloyd &quot; The Karezza Method &quot; } In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand. { E. Armand and &quot; la camaraderie amoureuse &quot;. Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy } He proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory. In France, there was also feminist activity inside individualist anarchism as promoted by individualist feminists Marie Küge, Anna Mahé, Rirette Maitrejean, and Sophia Zaïkovska. { &quot; Individualisme anarchiste et féminisme à la « Belle Epoque » &quot; } The Brazil ian individualist anarchist Maria Lacerda de Moura lectured on topics such as education, women&apos;s rights, free love, and antimilitarism.

[ Freethought ] [ Freethought ] Freethought as a philosophical position and as activism was important in both North American and European individualist anarchism. In the United States &quot; freethought was a basically anti-christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to Liberty were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of Freethought and, for a time, The Truth Seeker. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal Lucifer, the Light-Bearer &quot;. { [[Wendy McElroy ]. &quot; The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America &quot; ] } &quot; Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself &quot;. In Europe a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. &quot; Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist André Lorulot, will have its impacts in Estudios (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics. &quot;. { Xavier Diez. &apos;&apos;El anarquismo individualista en España (1923-1939)&apos;&apos; Virus Editorial. 2007. pg. 143 } This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of Charles-Auguste Bontemps and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine Ética and Iniciales &quot; there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and anti-theist obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin&apos;s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul. &quot;. { Xavier Diez. &apos;&apos;El anarquismo individualista en España (1923-1939)&apos;&apos; Virus Editorial. 2007. pg. 152 } [ Anarcho-naturism ] [ Naturism anarcho-naturism ] { Walden &apos;&apos; by } { Henry David Thoreau.

Wiley-Blackwell. 2009 } Naturism promoted an ecological worldview, small ecovillage s, and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity. Naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological, physical and psychological aspects and avoided, and tried to eliminate, social determinations. { &quot; el individuo es visto en su dimensión biológica -física y psíquica- dejándose la social. &quot; &quot; EL NATURISMO LIBERTARIO EN LA PENÍNSULA IBÉRICA (1890-1939) &quot; by Josep Maria Rosell } An early influence in this vein was Henry David Thoreau and his famous book Walden { &quot; Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea de que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. &quot; &quot; La insumisión voluntaria: El anarquismo individualista español durante la Dictadura y la Segunda República (1923-1938) &quot; by Xavier Díez } Important promoters of this were Henri Zisly and Emile Gravelle who collaborated in La Nouvelle Humanité followed by Le Naturien, Le Sauvage, L&apos;Ordre Naturel, &amp; La Vie Naturelle. { &quot; 1855 -- France: Emile Gravelle lives, Douai.

Published on Revista &apos;&apos;ADN&apos;&apos;. Winter 2003 } &quot; The linking role played by the ‘Sol y Vida’ group was very important. The goal of this group was to take trips and enjoy the open air. The Naturist athenaeum, ‘Ecléctico’, in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First Etica and then Iniciales, which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the Spanish Civil War. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to ‘Iniciales’ He writes it under the odd pseudonym of ‘silvestre del campo’, (wild man in the country). “I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society.” &quot;. &quot; The relation between Anarchism and Naturism gives way to the Naturist Federation, in July 1928, and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress, in September 1929, both supported by the Libertarian Movement. However, in the short term, the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life. The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner (real name of Han Ryner ) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI, ( Federación Anarquista Ibérica ) &quot;. [ Individualist anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche ] [ Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche#Individualist anarchism ] The thought of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been influential in individualist anarchism specifically in thinkers such as the French Emile Armand, { &quot; The life of Emile Armand (1872-1963) spanned the history of anarchism. He was influenced by Leo Tolstoy and Benjamin Tucker, and to a lesser extent by Whitman and Emerson.

[ Anglo American individualist anarchism ] [ Anarchism in the United States Individualist anarchism in the United States ] [ American mutualism and individualist utopianism ] { Stephen Pearl Andrews } { For } American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster &quot; It is apparent...that Proudhon ian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews... William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form. &quot;. { &apos;&apos;Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism&apos;&apos; by Eunice Minette Schuster } William Batchelder Greene (1819–1878) is best known for the works Mutual Banking(1850), which proposed an interest-free banking system, and Transcendentalism, a critique of the New England philosophical school. He saw mutualism as the synthesis of &quot; liberty and order. &quot; His &quot; associationism...is checked by individualism... &quot; Mind your own business, &quot; &quot; Judge not that ye be not judged. &quot; Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason he demands &quot; mutuality &quot; in marriage—the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property. &quot; feminist, &amp; spiritualist tendencies. &quot; { [[Hakim Bey ] } Contemporary American anarchist Hakim Bey reports that &quot; Steven Pearl Andrews...was not a fourierist (see Charles Fourier ), but he lived through the brief craze for phalansteries in America &amp; adopted a lot of fourierist principles &amp; practices...a maker of worlds out of words. He syncretized Abolitionism, Free Love, spiritual universalism, (Josiah) Warren, &amp; (Charles) Fourier into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy...He was instrumental in founding several “intentional communities,” including the “Brownstone Utopia” on 14th St. in New York, &amp; “ Modern Times ” in Brentwood, Long Island. The latter became as famous as the best-known fourierist communes (Brook Farm in Massachusetts &amp; the North American Phalanx in New Jersey) — in fact, Modern Times became downright notorious (for “ Free Love ”) &amp; finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity. Andrews ( &amp; Victoria Woodhull ) were members of the infamous Section 12 of the 1st International, expelled by Marx for its anarchist, feminist, &amp; spiritualist tendencies. &quot; [ The &quot; Boston Anarchists &quot; ] { Lysander Spooner } { Another } form of individualist anarchism was found in the United States, as advocated by the &quot; Boston anarchists. &quot; By default, American individualists had no difficulty accepting the concepts that &quot; one man employ another &quot; or that &quot; he direct him, &quot; in his labor but rather demanded that &quot; all natural opportunities requisite to the production of wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising from special privileges created by law be abolished. &quot; { Madison, Charles A. &quot; Anarchism in the United States. &quot; Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol 6, No 1, January 1945, p. 53. } They believed state monopoly capitalism (defined as a state-sponsored monopoly) { Schwartzman, Jack. &quot; Ingalls, Hanson, and Tucker: Nineteenth-Century American Anarchists. &quot; American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Vol. 62, No. 5 (November 2003). p. 325. } prevented labor from being fully rewarded. Voltairine de Cleyre, summed up the philosophy by saying that the anarchist individualists &quot; are firm in the idea that the system of employer and employed, buying and selling, banking, and all the other essential institutions of Commercialism, centred upon private property, are in themselves good, and are rendered vicious merely by the interference of the State. &quot; { de Cleyre, Voltairine.

Lysander Spooner besides his individualist anarchist activism was also an important anti-slavery activist and became a member of the First International. { George Woodcock.

Joseph Labadie (April 18, 1850 – October 7, 1933) was an American labor organizer, individualist anarchist, social activist, printer, publisher, essayist, and poet. In 1883 Labadie embraced a non-violent version of individualist anarchism. Without the oppression of the state, Labadie believed, humans would choose to harmonize with &quot; the great natural laws...without robbing [their] fellows through interest, profit, rent and taxes. &quot; However, he supported community cooperation, as he supported community control of water utilities, streets, and railroads. { Martin, James J. (1970). Men Against the State: The Expositors of Individualist Anarchism in America, 1827-1908. Colorado Springs: Ralph Myles Publisher. } Although he did not support the militant anarchism of the Haymarket anarchists, he fought for the clemency of the accused because he did not believe they were the perpetators. In 1888, Labadie organized the Michigan Federation of Labor, became its first president, and forged an alliance with Samuel Gompers. On the other hand Dyer Lum was a 19th-century American individualist anarchist labor activist and poet. [ Schuster Eunice Native American Anarchism Breakout Productions City 1999 9781893626218 168 (footnote 22) ] A leading anarcho-syndicalist and a prominent left-wing intellectual of the 1880s, [ Johnpoll Bernard Harvey Klehr Biographical Dictionary of the American Left Greenwood Press Westport 1986 9780313242007 ] he is remembered as the lover and mentor of early anarcha-feminist Voltairine de Cleyre. Lum was a prolific writer who wrote a number of key anarchist texts, and contributed to publications including Mother Earth, Twentieth Century, and, The Alarm (the journal of the International Working People&apos;s Association ) and The Open Court among others. Lum&apos;s political philosophy was a fusion of individualist anarchist economics – &quot; a radicalized form of laissez-faire economics &quot; inspired by the Boston anarchists – with radical labor organization similar to that of the Chicago anarchists of the time. [ http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2005/04/may-day-thoughts-individualist.html May Day Thoughts: Individualist Anarchism and the Labor Movement Carson Kevin Kevin Carson 2007-08-07 Mutualist Blog: Free Market Anti-Capitalism ] Herbert Spencer and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon influenced Lum strongly in his individualist tendency. He developed a &quot; mutualist &quot; theory of unions and as such was active within the Knights of Labor and later promoted anti-political strategies in the American Federation of Labor. Frustration with abolitionism, spiritualism, and labor reform caused Lum to embrace anarchism and radicalize workers, as he came to believe that revolution would inevitably involve a violent struggle between the working class and the employing class. Convinced of the necessity of violence to enact social change he volunteered to fight in the American Civil War, hoping thereby to bring about the end of slavery. Kevin Carson has praised Lum&apos;s fusion of individualist laissez-faire economics with radical labor activism as &quot; creative &quot; and described him as &quot; more significant than any in the Boston group &quot;. [ American egoism ] { Benjamin Tucker } { Some } of the American individualist anarchists later in this era, such as Benjamin Tucker, abandoned natural rights positions and converted to Max Stirner &apos;s Egoist anarchism. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said that there were only two rights, &quot; the right of might &quot; and &quot; the right of contract. &quot; He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, &quot; In times past...it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off....Man&apos;s only right to land is his might over it. &quot; { Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350 } In adopting Stirnerite egoism (1886), Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of Liberty in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, Liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly. &quot; { Wendy Mcelroy. &quot; Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order &quot; } &quot; Several periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by Liberty&apos;s presentation of egoism. They included: I published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of Liberty); The Ego and The Egoist, both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German Der Eigene, edited by Adolf Brand, and The Eagle and The Serpent, issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle &apos;A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology. { McElroy, Wendy. A Reconsideration of Trial by Jury, Forumulations, Winter 1998-1999, Free Nation Foundation } American anarchists who adhered to egoism include Benjamin Tucker, John Beverley Robinson, Steven T. Byington, Hutchins Hapgood, James L. Walker and Victor Yarros and E.H. Fulton. John Beverley Robinson wrote an essay called &quot; Egoism &quot; in which he states that &quot; Modern egoism, as propounded by Stirner and Nietzsche, and expounded by Ibsen, Shaw and others, is all these; but it is more. It is the realization by the individual that they are an individual; that, as far as they are concerned, they are the only individual. &quot; { &quot; Egoism &quot; by [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson ]] } Italian anti-organizationalist individualist anarchism was brought to the United States { &quot; it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity -- and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy. &quot; [[Murray Bookchin ]. } { Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm ] } by Italian born individualists such as Giuseppe Ciancabilla and others who advocated for violent propaganda by the deed there. Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports the incident in which the important Italian social anarchist Errico Malatesta became involved &quot; in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of Paterson, who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant. &quot; { Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 } Enrico Arrigoni (pseudonym: Frank Brand) was an Italian American individualist anarchist Lathe operator, house painter, bricklayer, dramatist and political activist influenced by the work of Max Stirner. { Enrico Arrigoni at the Daily Bleed&apos;s Anarchist Encyclopedia } { [[Paul Avrich ]. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America] } He took the pseudonym &quot; Brand &quot; from a fictional character in one of Henrik Ibsen ´s plays. In the 1910s he started becoming involved in anarchist and anti-war activism around Milan. From the 1910s until the 1920s he participated in anarchist activities and popular uprisings in various countries including Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Argentina and Cuba. He lived from the 1920s onwards in New York City and there he edited the individualist anarchist eclectic journal Eresia in 1928. He also wrote for other American anarchist publications such as L&apos; Adunata dei refrattari, Cultura Obrera, Controcorrente and Intessa Libertaria. During the Spanish Civil War, he went to fight with the anarchists but was imprisoned and was helped on his release by Emma Goldman. Afterwards Arrigoni became a longtime member of the Libertarian Book Club in New York City. His written works include The totalitarian nightmare (1975), The lunacy of the Superman (1977), Adventures in the country of the monoliths (1981) and Freedom: my dream (1986). [ Anarcho-capitalism ] (Rothbard circa 1955). [ Anarcho-capitalism ] 19th century individualist anarchists espoused the labor theory of value. Some believe that the modern movement of anarcho-capitalism is the result of simply removing the labor theory of value from ideas of the 19th century American individualist anarchists: &quot; Their successors today, such as Murray Rothbard, having abandoned the labor theory of value, describe themselves as anarcho-capitalists. &quot; { Outhwaite, William. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, Anarchism entry, } { Blackwell Publishing, 2003, p. 13 } As economic theory changed, the popularity of the labor theory of classical economics was superseded by the subjective theory of value of neo-classical economics. According to Kevin Carson (himself a mutualist ), &quot; most people who call themselves &quot; individualist anarchists &quot; today are followers of Murray Rothbard&apos;s Austrian economics. &quot; [ Carson Kevin Kevin Carson Studies in Mutualist Political Economy BookSurge Publishing Preface http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html 2007 1419658697 ] Murray Rothbard, a student of Ludwig von Mises, combined the Austrian school economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker. { Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 290 } In the mid-1950s Rothbard wrote an article under a pseudonym, saying that &quot; we are not anarchists...but not archists either...Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist, &quot; concerned with differentiating himself from communist and socialistic economic views of other anarchists (including the individualist anarchists of the 19th century). { Rothbard, Murray. Are Libertarians &apos;Anarchists&apos;?. LewRockwell.com. } However, Rothbard later chose the term &quot; anarcho-capitalism &quot; for his philosophy and referred to himself as an anarchist.

Most Agorists consider that property rights are natural right s deriving from the primary right of self-ownership. Because of this they are not opposed in principle to collectively held property if individual owners of the property consent to collective ownership by contract or other voluntary mutual agreement. However, Agorists are divided on the question of intellectual property rights.

For example, Emile Armand rejected violence and embraced mutualism while becoming an important propagandist for free love, while Albert Libertad and Zo d&apos;Axa were influential in violentists circles and championed violent propaganda by the deed while adhering to communitarianism or anarcho-communism { &quot; Libertad était un révolté, qui luttait non en dehors (tel les communautaires/colonies) ni à côté de la société (les éducationnistes), mais en son sein. Il sera énoncé comme une figure de l&apos;anarchisme individualiste, néanmoins, il ne se revendiquera jamais ainsi, même si il ne rejetait pas l&apos;individualisme, et que Libertad se revendiquait du communisme; plus tard, Mauricius, qui était un des éditeurs du journal &quot; l&apos;Anarchie &quot; dira &quot; Nous ne nous faisions pas d&apos;illusions, nous savions bien que cette libération totale de l&apos;individu dans la société capitaliste était impossible et que la réalisation de sa personnalité ne pourrait se faire que dans une société raisonnable, dont le communisme libertaire nous semblait être la meilleure expression. &quot;. Libertad s&apos;associait à la dynamique de révolte individuelle radicale au projet d&apos;émancipation collective. Il insistait sur la nécessité de développer le sentiment de camaraderie, afin de remplacer la concurrence qui était la morale de la société bourgeoise. &quot; &quot; Albert Libertad &quot; } and rejecting work. Han Ryner on the other side conciled anarchism with stoicism. Nevertheless French individualist circles had a strong sense of personal libertarianism and experimentation. Naturism and free love contents started to have a strong influence in individualist anarchist circles and from there it expanded to the rest of anarchism also appearing in Spanish individualist anarchist groups. &quot; Along with feverish activity against the social order, (Albert) Libertad was usually also organizing feasts, dances and country excursions, in consequence of his vision of anarchism as the “ joy of living ” and not as militant sacrifice and death instinct, seeking to reconcile the requirements of the individual (in his need for autonomy) with the need to destroy authoritarian society. &quot; { “Machete” #1. &quot; Bonnot and the Evangelists &quot; } Anarchist naturism was promoted by Henri Zisly, Emile Gravelle and Georges Butaud. Butaud was an individualist &quot; partisan of the milieux libres, publisher of &quot; Flambeau &quot; ( &quot; an enemy of authority &quot; ) in 1901 in Vienna. Most of his energies were devoted to creating anarchist colonies (communautés expérimentales) in which he participated in several. { http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/0226.htm &quot; 1926 -- France: Georges Butaud (1868-1926) dies, in Ermont. &quot; } &quot; In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist naturism, the strong defence of bith control methods, the idea of &quot; unions of egoists &quot; with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in symphathy within some, and a strong rejection within others. &quot; { &quot; La insumisión voluntaria.

The new base principles of the francophone Anarchist Federation were written by Charles-Auguste Bontemps and the anarcho-communist Maurice Joyeux which established an organization with a plurality of tendencies and autonomy of federated groups organized around synthesist principles. { &quot; Charles-Auguste Bontemps &quot; at Ephemeride Anarchiste } Charles-Auguste Bontemps was a prolific author mainly in the anarchist, freethinking, pacifist and naturist press of the time. His view on anarchism was based around his concept of &quot; Social Individualism &quot; on which he wrote extensively. He defended an anarchist perspective which consisted on &quot; a collectivism of things and an individualism of persons. &quot; { &quot; BONTEMPS Auguste, Charles, Marcel dit « Charles-Auguste »; « CHAB »; « MINXIT » &quot; at &apos;&apos;Dictionnaire International des Militants Anarchistes&apos;&apos; } In 2002, an anarchist, Libertad organized a new version of the L&apos;EnDehors, collaborating with Green Anarchy and including several contributors, such as Lawrence Jarach, Patrick Mignard, Thierry Lodé, Ron Sakolsky, and Thomas Slut. Numerous articles about capitalism, human rights, free love and social fights were published. The EnDehors continues now as a website, EnDehors.org. The prolific contemporary French philosopher Michel Onfray has been writing from an individualist anarchist { &quot; Au-delà, l’éthique et la politique de Michel Onfray font signe vers l’anarchisme individualiste de la Belle Epoque qui est d’ailleurs une de ses références explicites. &quot; &quot; Individualité et rapports à l&apos;engagement militant Individualite et rapports a l engageme &quot;.. par : Pereira Irène } perspective influenced by Nietzsche, French post-structuralists thinkers such as Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze; and Greek classical schools of philosophy such as the Cynics and Cyrenaics. Among the books which best expose Onfray&apos;s individualist anarchist perspective include La sculpture de soi : la morale esthétique (The sculpture of oneself: aesthetic morality), La philosophie féroce : exercices anarchistes, La puissance d&apos;exister and Physiologie de Georges Palante, portrait d&apos;un nietzchéen de gauche which focuses on French individualist philosopher Georges Palante. [ Illegalism ] [ Illegalism ] { Bonnot gang } Illegalism is an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland during the early 1900s as an outgrowth of Stirner&apos;s individualist anarchism. { &quot; Parallel to the social, collectivist anarchist current there was an individualist one whose partisans emphasized their individu�al freedom and advised other individuals to do the same. Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to authoritarian society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet. &quot; Thus theft, counterfeiting, swindling and robbery became a way of life for hundreds of individual�ists, as it was already for countless thousands of proletarians. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s (Auguste Vaillant, Ravachol, Emile Henry, Sante Caserio) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War (Clément Duval, Pini, Marius Jacob, the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital. &quot; } Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of &quot; might &quot; rather than &quot; right &quot;; for the most part, illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal, although some committed crimes as a form of propaganda of the deed. The illegalists embraced direct action and propaganda of the deed. { http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm } Influenced by theorist Max Stirner&apos;s egoism as well as Proudhon (his view that Property is theft! ), Clément Duval and Marius Jacob proposed the theory of la reprise individuelle (Eng: individual reclamation ) which justified robbery on the rich and personal direct action against exploiters and the system., Illegalism first rose to prominence among a generation of Europeans inspired by the unrest of the 1890s, during which Ravachol, Émile Henry, Auguste Vaillant, and Caserio committed daring crimes in the name of anarchism, { &quot; Pre-WWI France was the setting for the only documented anarchist revolutionary movement to embrace all illegal activity as revolutionary practice. Pick-pocketing, theft from the workplace, robbery, confidence scams, desertion from the armed forces, you name it, illegalist activity was praised as a justifiable and necessary aspect of class struggle. &quot; &quot; Illegalism &quot; by Rob los Ricos } in what is known as propaganda of the deed. France&apos;s Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism. [ Italy ] { Renzo Novatore } { In } Italy individualist anarchism had a strong tendency towards illegalism and violent propaganda by the deed similar to French individualist anarchism but perhaps more extreme { &quot; anarco-individualismo &quot; in italian anarchopedia } { &quot; At this point, encouraged by the disillusionment that followed the breakdown of the general strike, the terrorist individualists who had always -- despite Malatesta&apos;s influence -- survived as a small minority among Italian anarchists, intervened frightfully and tragically. &quot; } { George Woodcock.

At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant. &quot; } { George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 } In this respect we can consider notorious magnicides carried out or attempted by individualists Giovanni Passannante, Sante Caserio, Michele Angiolillo, Luigi Luccheni, Gaetano Bresci who murdered king Umberto I. Caserio lived in France and coexisted within French illegalism and later assassinated French president Sadi Carnot. The theoretical seeds of current Insurrectionary anarchism were already laid out at the end of 19th century Italy in a combination of individualist anarchism criticism of permanent groups and organization with a socialist class struggle worldview. { &quot; Essa trova soprattutto in America del Nord un notevole seguito per opera del Galleani che esprime una sintesi fra l&apos;istanza puramente individualista di stampo anglosassone e americano (ben espressa negli scritti di Tucker) e quella profondamente socialista del movimento anarchico di lingua italiana. Questa commistione di elementi individualisti e comunisti - che caratterizza bene la corrente antiorganizzatrice - rappresenta lo sforzo di quanti avvertirono in modo estremamente sensibile l&apos;invadente burocratismo che pervadeva il movimento operaio e socialista. &quot; &quot; anarchismo insurrezionale &quot; in italian anarchopedia } During the rise of fascism this thought also motivated Gino Lucetti, Michele Schirru and Angelo Sbardellotto in attempting the assassination of Benito Mussolini. During the early 20th century, the intellectual work of individualist anarchist Renzo Novatore came to importance; he was influenced by Stirner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Georges Palante, Oscar Wilde, Henrik Ibsen, Arthur Schopenhauer and Charles Baudelaire. He collaborated in numerous anarchist journals and participated in futurism avant-garde currents. In his thought, he adhered to Stirnerist disrespect for private property, only recognizing property of one&apos;s own spirit. &quot; Novatore non era contrario all&apos;abolizione della proprietà privata, poichè riteneva che l&apos;unica proprietà inviolabile fosse solo quella spirituale ed etica. Il suo pensiero è esplicitato in &quot; Verso il nulla creatore &quot; : { Bisogna che tutto ciò che si chiama &quot; proprietà materiale &quot;, &quot; proprietà privata &quot;, &quot; proprietà esteriore &quot; diventi per gli individui ciò che è il sole, la luce, il cielo, il mare, le stelle. E ciò avverrà!Avverrà perchè noi - gli iconoclasti - la violenteremo!Solo la ricchezza etica espirituale è invulnerabile. E&apos; vera proprietà dell&apos;individuo. Il resto no! Il resto è vulnerabile! E tutto ciò che è vulnerabile sarà vulnerato. &quot; &quot; Renzo Novatore &quot; in italian anarchopedia } Novatore collaborated in the individualist anarchist journal Iconoclasta! alongside the young stirner ist illegalist Bruno Filippi { &apos;&apos;The rebel&apos;s dark laughter: the writings of Bruno Filippi&apos;&apos; } The individualist philosopher and poet Renzo Novatore belonged to the leftist section of the avant-garde movement of Futurism { Novatore: una biografia } alongside other individualist anarcho-futurists such as Dante Carnesecchi, Leda Rafanelli, Auro d&apos;Arcola, and Giovanni Governato. Also there was Pietro Bruzzi who published the journal L&apos;Individualista in the 1920s alongside Ugo Fedeli and Francesco Ghezzi but who fell to fascist forces later. { &quot; L’Indivi-dualista &quot; � } { &quot; Pietro Bruzzi &quot; at italian anarchopedia } Pietro Bruzzi also collaborated with the Italian American individualist anarchist publication Eresia of New York City edited by Enrico Arrigoni. In Italy in 1945, during the Founding Congress of the Italian Anarchist Federation, there was a group of individualist anarchists led by Cesare Zaccaria { http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Storia_del_movimento_libertario_in_Italia &quot; Storia del movimento libertario in Italia &quot; in anarchopedia in Italian } who was an important anarchist of the time. { http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/73n6nh Cesare Zaccaria (19 August 1897-October 1961)Pier Carlo Masini and Paul Sharkey } Later, during the IX Congress of the Italian Anarchist Federation in Carrara in 1965, a group decided to split off from this organization and created the Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica. In the seventies, it was mostly composed of &quot; veteran individualist anarchists with an of pacifism orientation, naturism, etc,... &quot;. { &quot; Los anarco-individualistas, G.I.A...Una escisión de la FAI producida en el IX Congreso (Carrara, 1965) se pr odujo cuando un sector de anarquistas de tendencia humanista rechazan la interpretación que ellos juzgan disciplinaria del &apos;&apos;pacto asociativo &quot; clásico, y crean los GIA (Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica). Esta pequeña federación de grupos, hoy nutrida sobre todo de veteranos anarco-individualistas de orientación pacifista, naturista, etcétera defiende la autonomía personal y rechaza a rajatabla toda forma de intervención en los procesos del sistema, como sería por ejemplo el sindicalismo.

At the turn of the century, individualism in Spain gathered force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Mariano Gallardo, and J. Elizalde who translated French and American individualists. Important in this respect were also magazines such as La Idea Libre, La revista blanca, Etica, Iniciales, Al margen, Estudios and Nosotros. The most influential thinkers there were Max Stirner, Emile Armand and Han Ryner. Just as in France, the spread of Esperanto and anationalism had importance just as naturism and free love currents. Later, Armand and Ryner themselves started writing in the Spanish invidualist press. Armand&apos;s concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating polyamory as realization of the individual. Catalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of anarcho-communist groups and by members of the anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as Federico Urales and Miguel Gimenez Igualada who were members of the CNT and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the Iberian Anarchist Federation. { Xavier Diez. El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923-1938.

He also participated in the publishing of another individualist anarchist maganize Al Margen: Publicación quincenal individualista. { &quot; Entre los redactores y colaboradores de Al Margen, que trasladará su redacción a Elda, en Alicante, encontraremos a Miguel Giménez Igualada... &quot; La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública(1923-1938) por Xavier Diez } In his youth he engaged in illegalist activities. { Xavier Diez. &apos;&apos;L&apos;ANARQUISME INDIVIDUALISTA A ESPANYA 1923-1938&apos;&apos; } His thought was deeply influenced by Max Stirner, of which he was the main popularizer in Spain through his own writings. He published and wrote the preface to the fourth edition in Spanish of The Ego and Its Own from 1900. He proposed the creation of a Union of Egoists, to be a Federation of Individualist Anarchists in Spain, but did not succeed. { &quot; A partir de la década de los treinta, su pensamiento empieza a derivar hacia el individualismo, y como profundo estirneriano tratará de impulsar una federación de individualistas &quot; &quot; La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública(1923-1938) por Xavier Diez } In 1956 he published an extensive treatise on Stirner, dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Emile Armand { &quot; Stirner &quot; por Miguel Gimenez Igualada } Afterwards he traveled and lived in Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico. Federico Urales was an important individualist anarchist who edited La Revista Blanca. The individualist anarchism of Urales was influenced by Auguste Comte and Charles Darwin. He saw science and reason as a defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of influential individualist thinkers such as Nietzsche and Stirner for promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an individualism with solidarity seen as a way to guarantee social equality and harmony. He was highly critical of anarcho-syndicalism, which he viewed as plagued by excessive bureaucracy, and thought that it tended towards reformism. Instead he favored small groups based on ideological alignement. He supported and participated in the establishment of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI) in 1927. In 1956, on exile escaping from Franco´s dictatorship Miguel Giménez Igualada published an extensive treatise on Stirner which he dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Emile Armand On the subject of individualist anarchist theory, he publisheds Anarchism in 1968, during his exile in Mexico from Franco&apos;s dictatorship in Spain. { &apos;&apos;Anarquismo&apos;&apos; by Miguel Gimenez Igualada } He was present in the First Congress of the Mexican Anarchist Federation in 1945. { Miguel Gimenez Igualada. &apos;&apos;Anarquismo&apos;&apos; } In 2000, in Spain Ateneo Libertario Ricardo Mella, Ateneo libertario Al Margen, Ateneu Enciclopèdic Popular, Ateneo Libertario de Sant Boi, Ateneu Llibertari Poble Sec y Fundació D&apos;Estudis Llibertaris i Anarcosindicalistes republished Emile Armand&apos;s writings on Free Love and individualist anarchism in a compilation titled Individualist anarchism and Amorous camaraderie. { &apos;&apos;Individualismo anarquista y camaradería amorosa&apos;&apos; by [[Emile Armand ]] } Recently Catalan historian Xavier Diez has dedicated extensive research on Spanish individualist anarchism as can be seen in his books El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923-1938 { &apos;&apos;El anarquismo individualista en España.&apos;&apos; by Xavier Diez } and Utopia sexual a la premsa anarquista de Catalunya.

He fused Stirnerist egoism with the positions of Benjamin Tucker and actually translated Tucker into German. Two semi-fictional writings of his own, Die Anarchisten and Der Freiheitsucher, contributed to individualist theory through an updating of egoist themes within a consideration of the anarchist movement. English translations of these works arrived in the United Kingdom and in individualist American circles led by Tucker. { &quot; New England Anarchism in Germany &quot; by Thomas A. Riley } McKay is also known as an important European early activist for Gay rights. Using the pseudonym Sagitta, Mackay wrote a series of works for pederastic emancipation, titled Die Buecher der namenlosen Liebe (Books of the Nameless Love). This series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913 and included the Fenny Skaller, a story of a pederast. { thamyris 02 } Under the same pseudonym he also published fiction, such as Holland (1924) and a pederastic novel of the Berlin boy-bars, Der Puppenjunge (The Hustler) (1926). { Der Eigene &apos;&apos; } { stirner ist pioneer Gay activist publication } Adolf Brand (1874–1945) was a German writer, stirner ist anarchist and pioneering campaigner for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality.

Der Eigene concentrated on cultural and scholarly material, and may have had an average of around 1500 subscribers per issue during its lifetime, although the exact numbers are uncertain. Contributors included Erich Mühsam, Kurt Hiller, John Henry Mackay (under the pseudonym Sagitta) and artists Wilhelm von Gloeden, Fidus and Sascha Schneider.

It appeared in 1919, as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseud. for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseud. for Salomo Friedlaender ).

Tucker, in fact, published an American edition. From its early championing of Walt Whitman&apos;s Leaves of Grass to a series of short stories by Francis du Bosque in its last issues, Liberty was a vehicle of controversial, avant-garde literature. &quot; &quot; Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order &quot; by Wendy McElroy } In his important essay The Soul of Man under Socialism from 1891 he defended socialism as the way to guarantee individualism and so he saw that &quot; With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all. &quot; { &quot; [[The Soul of Man under Socialism ] &quot; by } { Oscar Wilde ] } For anarchist historian George Woodcock &quot; Wilde&apos;s aim in The Soul of Man under Socialism is to seek the society most favorable to the artist...for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated...Wilde represents the anarchist as aesthete. &quot; { George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962. (pg. 447) } Woodocock finds that &quot; The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde The Soul of Man under Socialism &quot; and finds that it is influenced mainly by the thought of William Godwin. In the late 19th century in the United Kingdom, there existed individualist anarchists such as Wordsworth Donisthorpe, Joseph Hiam Levy, Joseph Greevz Fisher, John Badcock, Jr., Albert Tarn, and Henry Seymour { &quot; The English Individualists As They Appear In Liberty &quot; by Carl Watner } who were close to the United States group around Benjamin Tucker ´s magazine Liberty.

He writes: Max Stirner&apos;s impact on contemporary political theory is often neglected. However in Stirner&apos;s political thinking there can be found a surprising convergence with poststructuralist theory, particularly with regard to the function of power. Andrew Koch, for instance, sees Stirner as a thinker who transcends the Hegelian tradition he is usually placed in, arguing that his work is a precursor poststructuralist ideas about the foundations of knowledge and truth. { &quot; War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze&apos;s Anarchism &quot; by [[Saul Newman ]] } Newman has published several essays on Stirner. &quot; War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze&apos;s Anarchism &quot; and &quot; Empiricism, pluralism, and politics in Deleuze and Stirner &quot; { &quot; Empiricism, pluralism, and politics in Deleuze and Stirner &quot; by Saul Newman } discusses what he sees are similarities between Stirner&apos;s thought and that of Gilles Deleuze.

[ Paul Avrich Avrich Paul The Russian Anarchists AK Press Stirling 2006 1904859488 56 ] The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists were predominantly drawn from the intelligentsia and the working class. For anarchist historian Paul Avrich &quot; The two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in Moscow, were Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi and Lev Chernyi (Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From Nietzsche, they inherited the desire for a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois societypolitical, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced by Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker, the German and American theorists of individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human personality from the fetters of organized society. &quot; Some Russian individualists anarchists &quot; found the ultimate expression of their social alienation in violence and crime, others attached themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the majority remained &quot; philosophical &quot; anarchists who conducted animated parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in ponderous journals and books. &quot; Lev Chernyi was an important individualist anarchist involved in resistance against the rise to power of the Bolchevik Party. He adhered mainly to Stirner and the ideas of Benjamin Tucker. In 1907, he published a book entitled Associational Anarchism, in which he advocated the &quot; free association of independent individuals. &quot;. { &quot; Prominent Anarchists and Left-Libertarians &quot; } On his return from Siberia in 1917 he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers as a lecturer. Chernyi was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March 1917. He was an advocate &quot; for the seizure of private homes &quot;, which was an activity seen by the anarchists after the October revolution as direct expropriation on the bourgoise. He died after being accused of participation in an episode in which this group bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party. Although most likely not being really involved in the bombing, he might have died of torture. Chernyi advocated a Nietzschean overthrow of the values of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary communes of anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin as a threat to the freedom of the individual.

He says the first is the type associated with William Godwin that advocates self-government with a &quot; progressive rationalism that included benevolence to others. &quot; The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of Egoism, as most associated with Max Stirner. The third type is &quot; found in Herbert Spencer &apos;s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as Donisthorpe, foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution. &quot; The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships. γ [ C γ none ] See, for example, the Winter 2006 issue of the Journal of Libertarian Studies, dedicated to reviews of Kevin Carson&apos;s Studies in Mutualist Political Economy.

Since medieval times, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters. Most population data pre-1905 is based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the Jerusalem District. { Usiel Oskar Schmelz, in Ottoman Palestine, 1800-1914: studies in economic and social history, Gad G. Gilbar, Brill Archive, 1990 } These estimates suggest that since the end of the Crusades, Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century. Between 1838 and 1876, a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became a majority of the population. [ Current demographics ] In December 2007, Jerusalem had a population of 747,600—64% were Jewish, 32% Muslim, and 2% Christian. At the end of 2005, the population density was [ 5750.4 /km2 /sqmi on ].

The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City&apos;s 32,488 people were Jews. { &quot; Arab population growth outpaces Jews in Jerusalem &quot; Reuters, 26 September 2000 } { Ezrat Torah, a } { Haredi neighborhood } In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in. Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem&apos;s 180,000 households is 3.8 people. In 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%. This would seem to corroborate the observation that the percentage of Jews in Jerusalem has declined over the past four decades. In 1967, Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent.
